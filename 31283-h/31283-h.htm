<p><span class="smcap">The</span> essays here brought together are meant to
illustrate English literary criticism during the nineteenth
century. A companion volume representative
of Renaissance and Neo-classic criticism will,
it is hoped, be issued at a future date. Meanwhile
this volume may well go forth alone. For the nineteenth
century forms an epoch in English literature
whose beginnings are more clearly defined
than those of most literary epochs. The publication
of the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> in 1798, and of Wordsworth&#8217;s
Preface to the second edition in 1800, show
the Romantic Movement grown conscious and deliberate,
with results that have coloured the whole
stream of English poetry and criticism ever since.</p>

<p>The greater part of the present collection deals
with general principles rather than with criticisms
of individual books or authors. The nineteenth
century, having discarded the dogmas and &#8216;rules&#8217;
of Neo-classicism, had perforce to investigate
afresh the Theory of Poetry, and though no systematic
treatment of the subject in all its bearings
appeared, some valuable contributions were made,
the most notable of which came from the poets
themselves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>The extracts from the <i>Biographia Literaria</i> are
placed next to the Wordsworthian doctrines
which they criticize; otherwise the arrangement
of the essays is chronological.</p>

<p>American criticism is represented&mdash;inadequately,
but, it is hoped, not unworthily&mdash;by the last two
essays.</p>

<p>In the preparation of this volume I have received
much valuable help from Mr. J.&nbsp;C. Smith,
which I now gratefully acknowledge.</p>

<h3>POETRY AND POETIC DICTION</h3>

<h4>[Preface to the Second Edition of <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>, 1800]</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first Volume of these Poems has already
been submitted to general perusal. It was published,
as an experiment, which, I hoped, might
be of some use to ascertain, how far, by fitting
to metrical arrangement a selection of the real
language of men in a state of vivid sensation, that
sort of pleasure and that quantity of pleasure
may be imparted, which a Poet may rationally
endeavour to impart.</p>

<p>I had formed no very inaccurate estimate of
the probable effect of those Poems: I flattered
myself that they who should be pleased with
them would read them with more than common
pleasure: and, on the other hand, I was well
aware, that by those who should dislike them,
they would be read with more than common
dislike. The result has differed from my expectation
in this only, that a greater number have
been pleased than I ventured to hope I should
please.</p>

<p class="dotted">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Several of my Friends are anxious for the
success of these Poems, from a belief, that, if the
views with which they were composed were indeed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
realized, a class of Poetry would be produced, well
adapted to interest mankind permanently, and not
unimportant in the quality, and in the multiplicity
of its moral relations: and on this account they
have advised me to prefix a systematic defence of
the theory upon which the Poems were written.
But I was unwilling to undertake the task, knowing
that on this occasion the Reader would look coldly
upon my arguments, since I might be suspected of
having been principally influenced by the selfish
and foolish hope of <i>reasoning</i> him into an approbation
of these particular Poems: and I was still
more unwilling to undertake the task, because,
adequately to display the opinions, and fully to
enforce the arguments, would require a space
wholly disproportionate to a preface. For, to
treat the subject with the clearness and coherence
of which it is susceptible, it would be necessary
to give a full account of the present state of the
public taste in this country, and to determine
how far this taste is healthy or depraved; which,
again, could not be determined, without pointing
out in what manner language and the human
mind act and re-act on each other, and without
retracing the revolutions, not of literature alone,
but likewise of society itself. I have therefore
altogether declined to enter regularly upon this
defence; yet I am sensible, that there would be
something like impropriety in abruptly obtruding
upon the Public, without a few words of introduction,
Poems so materially different from those
upon which general approbation is at present
bestowed.</p>

<p>It is supposed, that by the act of writing in
verse an Author makes a formal engagement that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
he will gratify certain known habits of association;
that he not only thus apprises the Reader that
certain classes of ideas and expressions will be
found in his book, but that others will be carefully
excluded. This exponent or symbol held forth
by metrical language must in different eras of
literature have excited very different expectations:
for example, in the age of Catullus, Terence, and
Lucretius, and that of Statius or Claudian; and
in our own country, in the age of Shakespeare and
Beaumont and Fletcher, and that of Donne and
Cowley, or Dryden, or Pope. I will not take upon
me to determine the exact import of the promise
which, by the act of writing in verse, an Author
in the present day makes to his reader: but it
will undoubtedly appear to many persons that
I have not fulfilled the terms of an engagement
thus voluntarily contracted. They who have been
accustomed to the gaudiness and inane phraseology
of many modern writers, if they persist in reading
this book to its conclusion, will, no doubt, frequently
have to struggle with feelings of strangeness and
awkwardness: they will look round for poetry,
and will be induced to inquire by what species of
courtesy these attempts can be permitted to
assume that title. I hope therefore the reader
will not censure me for attempting to state what
I have proposed to myself to perform; and also
(as far as the limits of a preface will permit) to
explain some of the chief reasons which have
determined me in the choice of my purpose: that
at least he may be spared any unpleasant feeling
of disappointment, and that I myself may be
protected from one of the most dishonourable
accusations which can be brought against an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Author; namely, that of an indolence which
prevents him from endeavouring to ascertain
what is his duty, or, when his duty is ascertained,
prevents him from performing it.</p>

<p>The principal object, then, proposed in these
Poems was to choose incidents and situations
from common life, and to relate or describe them,
throughout, as far as was possible in a selection
of language really used by men, and, at the same
time, to throw over them a certain colouring of
imagination, whereby ordinary things should be
presented to the mind in an unusual aspect; and,
further, and above all, to make these incidents
and situations interesting by tracing in them,
truly though not ostentatiously, the primary laws
of our nature: chiefly, as far as regards the
manner in which we associate ideas in a state of
excitement. Humble and rustic life was generally
chosen, because, in that condition, the essential
passions of the heart find a better soil in which
they can attain their maturity, are less under
restraint, and speak a plainer and more emphatic
language; because in that condition of life our
elementary feelings coexist in a state of greater
simplicity, and, consequently, may be more
accurately contemplated, and more forcibly
communicated; because the manners of rural
life germinate from those elementary feelings,
and, from the necessary character of rural
occupations, are more easily comprehended, and
are more durable; and, lastly, because in that
condition the passions of men are incorporated
with the beautiful and permanent forms of nature.
The language, too, of these men has been adopted
(purified indeed from what appear to be its real<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
defects, from all lasting and rational causes of
dislike or disgust) because such men hourly
communicate with the best objects from which
the best part of language is originally derived;
and because, from their rank in society and the
sameness and narrow circle of their intercourse,
being less under the influence of social vanity,
they convey their feelings and notions in simple
and unelaborated expressions. Accordingly, such
a language, arising out of repeated experience and
regular feelings, is a more permanent, and a far
more philosophical language, than that which is
frequently substituted for it by Poets, who think
that they are conferring honour upon themselves
and their art, in proportion as they separate
themselves from the sympathies of men, and
indulge in arbitrary and capricious habits of
expression, in order to furnish food for fickle tastes,
and fickle appetites, of their own creation.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>I cannot, however, be insensible to the present
outcry against the triviality and meanness, both
of thought and language, which some of my
contemporaries have occasionally introduced into
their metrical compositions; and I acknowledge
that this defect, where it exists, is more dishonourable
to the Writer&#8217;s own character than false
refinement or arbitrary innovation, though I should
contend at the same time, that it is far less pernicious
in the sum of its consequences. From such verses
the Poems in these volumes will be found distinguished
at least by one mark of difference, that each
of them has a worthy <i>purpose</i>. Not that I always
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>began to write with a distinct purpose formally
conceived; but habits of meditation have, I trust,
so prompted and regulated my feelings, that my
descriptions of such objects as strongly excite those
feelings, will be found to carry along with them
a <i>purpose</i>. If this opinion be erroneous, I can have
little right to the name of a Poet. For all good
poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful
feelings: and though this be true, Poems to which
any value can be attached were never produced
on any variety of subjects but by a man who,
being possessed of more than usual organic
sensibility, had also thought long and deeply.
For our continued influxes of feeling are modified
and directed by our thoughts, which are indeed
the representatives of all our past feelings; and,
as by contemplating the relation of these general
representatives to each other, we discover what
is really important to men, so, by the repetition
and continuance of this act, our feelings will be
connected with important subjects, till at length,
if we be originally possessed of much sensibility,
such habits of mind will be produced, that, by
obeying blindly and mechanically the impulses of
those habits, we shall describe objects, and utter
sentiments, of such a nature, and in such connexion
with each other, that the understanding of the
Reader must necessarily be in some degree
enlightened, and his affections strengthened and
purified.</p>

<p>It has been said that each of these poems
has a purpose. Another circumstance must be
mentioned which distinguishes these Poems from
the popular Poetry of the day; it is this, that
the feeling therein developed gives importance to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the action and situation, and not the action and
situation to the feeling.</p>

<p>A sense of false modesty shall not prevent me
from asserting, that the Reader&#8217;s attention is
pointed to this mark of distinction, far less for
the sake of these particular Poems than from the
general importance of the subject. The subject
is indeed important! For the human mind is
capable of being excited without the application
of gross and violent stimulants; and he must
have a very faint perception of its beauty and
dignity who does not know this, and who does
not further know, that one being is elevated above
another, in proportion as he possesses this capability.
It has therefore appeared to me, that to
endeavour to produce or enlarge this capability is
one of the best services in which, at any period,
a Writer can be engaged; but this service,
excellent at all times, is especially so at the
present day. For a multitude of causes, unknown
to former times, are now acting with a combined
force to blunt the discriminating powers of the
mind, and, unfitting it for all voluntary exertion,
to reduce it to a state of almost savage torpor.
The most effective of these causes are the great
national events which are daily taking place, and
the increasing accumulation of men in cities,
where the uniformity of their occupations produces
a craving for extraordinary incident, which the
rapid communication of intelligence hourly gratifies.
To this tendency of life and manners the literature
and theatrical exhibitions of the country have
conformed themselves. The invaluable works of
our elder writers, I had almost said the works of
Shakespeare and Milton, are driven into neglect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
by frantic novels, sickly and stupid German
Tragedies, and deluges of idle and extravagant
stories in verse.&mdash;When I think upon this degrading
thirst after outrageous stimulation, I am almost
ashamed to have spoken of the feeble endeavour
made in these volumes to counteract it; and,
reflecting upon the magnitude of the general evil,
I should be oppressed with no dishonourable
melancholy, had I not a deep impression of certain
inherent and indestructible qualities of the human
mind, and likewise of certain powers in the great
and permanent objects that act upon it, which
are equally inherent and indestructible; and were
there not added to this impression a belief, that
the time is approaching when the evil will be
systematically opposed, by men of greater powers,
and with far more distinguished success.</p>

<p>Having dwelt thus long on the subjects and
aim of these Poems, I shall request the Reader&#8217;s
permission to apprise him of a few circumstances
relating to their <i>style</i>, in order, among other
reasons, that he may not censure me for not
having performed what I never attempted. The
Reader will find that personifications of abstract
ideas rarely occur in these volumes; and are
utterly rejected, as an ordinary device to elevate
the style, and raise it above prose. My purpose
was to imitate, and, as far as possible, to adopt
the very language of men; and assuredly such
personifications do not make any natural or regular
part of that language. They are, indeed, a figure
of speech occasionally prompted by passion, and
I have made use of them as such; but have
endeavoured utterly to reject them as a mechanical
device of style, or as a family language which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Writers in metre seem to lay claim to by prescription.
I have wished to keep the Reader in
the company of flesh and blood, persuaded that
by so doing I shall interest him. Others who
pursue a different track will interest him likewise;
I do not interfere with their claim, but wish to
prefer a claim of my own. There will also be found
in these volumes little of what is usually called
poetic diction; as much pains has been taken to
avoid it as is ordinarily taken to produce it; this
has been done for the reason already alleged, to
bring my language near to the language of men;
and further, because the pleasure which I have
proposed to myself to impart, is of a kind very
different from that which is supposed by many
persons to be the proper object of poetry. Without
being culpably particular, I do not know how to
give my Reader a more exact notion of the style
in which it was my wish and intention to write,
than by informing him that I have at all times
endeavoured to look steadily at my subject;
consequently, there is I hope in these Poems
little falsehood of description, and my ideas are
expressed in language fitted to their respective
importance. Something must have been gained
by this practice, as it is friendly to one property
of all good poetry, namely, good sense: but it
has necessarily cut me off from a large portion of
phrases and figures of speech which from father
to son have long been regarded as the common
inheritance of Poets. I have also thought it
expedient to restrict myself still further, having
abstained from the use of many expressions, in
themselves proper and beautiful, but which have
been foolishly repeated by bad Poets, till such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
feelings of disgust are connected with them as it
is scarcely possible by any art of association to
overpower.</p>

<p>If in a poem there should be found a series of
lines, or even a single line, in which the language,
though naturally arranged, and according to the
strict laws of metre, does not differ from that of
prose, there is a numerous class of critics, who,
when they stumble upon these prosaisms, as they
call them, imagine that they have made a notable
discovery, and exult over the Poet as over a man
ignorant of his own profession. Now these men
would establish a canon of criticism which the
Reader will conclude he must utterly reject, if he
wishes to be pleased with these volumes. And it
would be a most easy task to prove to him, that
not only the language of a large portion of every
good poem, even of the most elevated character,
must necessarily, except with reference to the
metre, in no respect differ from that of good prose,
but likewise that some of the most interesting
parts of the best poems will be found to be strictly
the language of prose when prose is well written.
The truth of this assertion might be demonstrated
by innumerable passages from almost all the
poetical writings, even of Milton himself. To
illustrate the subject in a general manner, I will
here adduce a short composition of Gray, who
was at the head of those who, by their reasonings,
have attempted to widen the space of separation
betwixt Prose and Metrical composition, and was
more than any other man curiously elaborate in
the structure of his own poetic diction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>It will easily be perceived, that the only part of
this Sonnet which is of any value is the lines printed
in Italics; it is equally obvious, that, except in the
rhyme, and in the use of the single word &#8216;fruitless&#8217;
for fruitlessly, which is so far a defect, the language
of these lines does in no respect differ from that of
prose.</p>

<p>By the foregoing quotation it has been shown
that the language of Prose may yet be well
adapted to Poetry; and it was previously asserted,
that a large portion of the language of every good
poem can in no respect differ from that of good
Prose. We will go further. It may be safely
affirmed, that there neither is, nor can be, any
<i>essential</i> difference between the language of prose
and metrical composition. We are fond of tracing
the resemblance between Poetry and Painting,
and, accordingly, we call them Sisters: but where
shall we find bonds of connexion sufficiently strict
to typify the affinity betwixt metrical and prose
composition? They both speak by and to the
same organs; the bodies in which both of them
are clothed may be said to be of the same substance,
their affections are kindred, and almost identical,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
not necessarily differing even in degree; Poetry<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
sheds no tears &#8216;such as Angels weep&#8217;, but natural
and human tears; she can boast of no celestial
ichor that distinguishes her vital juices from those
of prose; the same human blood circulates through
the veins of them both.</p>

<p>If it be affirmed that rhyme and metrical
arrangement of themselves constitute a distinction
which overturns what has just been said on the
strict affinity of metrical language with that of
prose, and paves the way for other artificial
distinctions which the mind voluntarily admits,
I answer that the language of such Poetry as is
here recommended is, as far as is possible, a selection
of the language really spoken by men; that this
selection, wherever it is made with true taste and
feeling, will of itself form a distinction far greater
than would at first be imagined, and will entirely
separate the composition from the vulgarity and
meanness of ordinary life; and, if metre be
superadded thereto, I believe that a dissimilitude
will be produced altogether sufficient for the
gratification of a rational mind. What other
distinction would we have? Whence is it to
come? And where is it to exist? Not, surely,
where the Poet speaks through the mouths of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>characters: it cannot be necessary here, either
for elevation of style, or any of its supposed
ornaments: for, if the Poet&#8217;s subject be judiciously
chosen, it will naturally, and upon fit occasion,
lead him to passions the language of which, if
selected truly and judiciously, must necessarily
be dignified and variegated, and alive with
metaphors and figures. I forbear to speak of an
incongruity which would shock the intelligent
Reader, should the Poet interweave any foreign
splendour of his own with that which the passion
naturally suggests: it is sufficient to say that such
addition is unnecessary. And, surely, it is more
probable that those passages, which with propriety
abound with metaphors and figures, will have their
due effect, if, upon other occasions where the
passions are of a milder character, the style also
be subdued and temperate.</p>

<p>But, as the pleasure which I hope to give by
the Poems now presented to the Reader must
depend entirely on just notions upon this subject,
and, as it is in itself of high importance to our
taste and moral feelings, I cannot content myself
with these detached remarks. And if, in what I
am about to say, it shall appear to some that my
labour is unnecessary, and that I am like a man
fighting a battle without enemies, such persons
may be reminded, that, whatever be the language
outwardly holden by men, a practical faith in the
opinions which I am wishing to establish is almost
unknown. If my conclusions are admitted, and
carried as far as they must be carried if admitted
at all, our judgements concerning the works of
the greatest Poets both ancient and modern will
be far different from what they are at present,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
both when we praise, and when we censure: and
our moral feelings influencing and influenced by
these judgements will, I believe, be corrected and
purified.</p>

<p>Taking up the subject, then, upon general
grounds, let me ask, what is meant by the word
Poet? What is a Poet? To whom does he
address himself? And what language is to be
expected from him?&mdash;He is a man speaking to
men: a man, it is true, endowed with more
lively sensibility, more enthusiasm and tenderness,
who has a greater knowledge of human nature,
and a more comprehensive soul, than are supposed
to be common among mankind; a man pleased
with his own passions and volitions, and who
rejoices more than other men in the spirit of life
that is in him; delighting to contemplate similar
volitions and passions as manifested in the goings-on
of the Universe, and habitually impelled to
create them where he does not find them. To
these qualities he has added a disposition to be
affected more than other men by absent things as if
they were present; an ability of conjuring up in
himself passions, which are indeed far from being
the same as those produced by real events, yet
(especially in those parts of the general sympathy
which are pleasing and delightful) do more nearly
resemble the passions produced by real events,
than anything which, from the motions of their
own minds merely, other men are accustomed to
feel in themselves:&mdash;whence, and from practice,
he has acquired a greater readiness and power in
expressing what he thinks and feels, and especially
those thoughts and feelings which, by his own
choice, or from the structure of his own mind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
arise in him without immediate external excitement.</p>

<p>But whatever portion of this faculty we may
suppose even the greatest Poet to possess, there
cannot be a doubt that the language which it will
suggest to him, must often, in liveliness and truth,
fall short of that which is uttered by men in real
life, under the actual pressure of those passions,
certain shadows of which the Poet thus produces,
or feels to be produced, in himself.</p>

<p>However exalted a notion we would wish to
cherish of the character of a Poet, it is obvious,
that while he describes and imitates passions,
his employment is in some degree mechanical,
compared with the freedom and power of real
and substantial action and suffering. So that it
will be the wish of the Poet to bring his feelings
near to those of the persons whose feelings he
describes, nay, for short spaces of time, perhaps,
to let himself slip into an entire delusion, and
even confound and identify his own feelings with
theirs; modifying only the language which is
thus suggested to him by a consideration that he
describes for a particular purpose, that of giving
pleasure. Here, then, he will apply the principle
of selection which has been already insisted upon.
He will depend upon this for removing what would
otherwise be painful or disgusting in the passion;
he will feel that there is no necessity to trick out
or to elevate nature: and, the more industriously
he applies this principle, the deeper will be his
faith that no words, which <i>his</i> fancy or imagination
can suggest, will be to be compared with those
which are the emanations of reality and truth.</p>

<p>But it may be said by those who do not object<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to the general spirit of these remarks, that, as it
is impossible for the Poet to produce upon all
occasions language as exquisitely fitted for the
passion as that which the real passion itself
suggests, it is proper that he should consider
himself as in the situation of a translator, who
does not scruple to substitute excellencies of
another kind for those which are unattainable
by him; and endeavours occasionally to surpass
his original, in order to make some amends for
the general inferiority to which he feels that he
must submit. But this would be to encourage
idleness and unmanly despair. Further, it is the
language of men who speak of what they do not
understand; who talk of Poetry as of a matter
of amusement and idle pleasure; who will converse
with us as gravely about a <i>taste</i> for Poetry,
as they express it, as if it were a thing as indifferent
as a taste for rope-dancing, or Frontiniac or Sherry.
Aristotle, I have been told, has said, that Poetry
is the most philosophic of all writing: it is so:
its object is truth, not individual and local, but
general, and operative; not standing upon external
testimony, but carried alive into the heart by
passion; truth which is its own testimony, which
gives competence and confidence to the tribunal
to which it appeals, and receives them from the
same tribunal. Poetry is the image of man and
nature. The obstacles which stand in the way of
the fidelity of the Biographer and Historian, and
of their consequent utility, are incalculably greater
than those which are to be encountered by the
Poet who comprehends the dignity of his art.
The Poet writes under one restriction only,
namely, the necessity of giving immediate pleasure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to a human Being possessed of that information
which may be expected from him, not as a lawyer,
a physician, a mariner, an astronomer, or a natural
philosopher, but as a Man. Except this one
restriction, there is no object standing between
the Poet and the image of things; between this,
and the Biographer and Historian, there are
a thousand.</p>

<p>Nor let this necessity of producing immediate
pleasure be considered as a degradation of the
Poet&#8217;s art. It is far otherwise. It is an acknowledgement
of the beauty of the universe, an
acknowledgement the more sincere, because not
formal, but indirect; it is a task light and easy
to him who looks at the world in the spirit of
love: further, it is a homage paid to the native
and naked dignity of man, to the grand elementary
principle of pleasure, by which he knows, and feels,
and lives, and moves. We have no sympathy but
what is propagated by pleasure: I would not be
misunderstood; but wherever we sympathize with
pain, it will be found that the sympathy is produced
and carried on by subtle combinations with pleasure.
We have no knowledge, that is, no general principles
drawn from the contemplation of particular facts,
but what has been built up by pleasure, and exists
in us by pleasure alone. The Man of science, the
Chemist and Mathematician, whatever difficulties
and disgusts they may have had to struggle with,
know and feel this. However painful may be the
objects with which the Anatomist&#8217;s knowledge is
connected, he feels that his knowledge is pleasure;
and where he has no pleasure he has no knowledge.
What then does the Poet? He considers man
and the objects that surround him as acting and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
re-acting upon each other, so as to produce an
infinite complexity of pain and pleasure; he
considers man in his own nature and in his ordinary
life as contemplating this with a certain quantity
of immediate knowledge, with certain convictions,
intuitions, and deductions, which from habit
acquire the quality of intuitions; he considers
him as looking upon this complex scene of ideas
and sensations, and finding everywhere objects
that immediately excite in him sympathies which,
from the necessities of his nature, are accompanied
by an overbalance of enjoyment.</p>

<p>To this knowledge which all men carry about
with them, and to these sympathies in which,
without any other discipline than that of our
daily life, we are fitted to take delight, the Poet
principally directs his attention. He considers
man and nature as essentially adapted to each
other, and the mind of man as naturally the
mirror of the fairest and most interesting properties
of nature. And thus the Poet, prompted by this
feeling of pleasure, which accompanies him through
the whole course of his studies, converses with
general nature, with affections akin to those, which,
through labour and length of time, the Man of
science has raised up in himself, by conversing
with those particular parts of nature which are
the objects of his studies. The knowledge both of
the Poet and the Man of science is pleasure; but
the knowledge of the one cleaves to us as a necessary
part of our existence, our natural and unalienable
inheritance; the other is a personal and individual
acquisition, slow to come to us, and by no habitual
and direct sympathy connecting us with our fellow-beings.
The Man of science seeks truth as a remote<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and unknown benefactor; he cherishes and loves
it in his solitude: the Poet, singing a song in which
all human beings join with him, rejoices in the
presence of truth as our visible friend and hourly
companion. Poetry is the breath and finer spirit
of all knowledge; it is the impassioned expression
which is in the countenance of all Science. Emphatically
may it be said of the Poet, as Shakespeare
hath said of man, &#8216;that he looks before and after.&#8217;
He is the rock of defence for human nature; an
upholder and preserver, carrying everywhere with
him relationship and love. In spite of difference
of soil and climate, of language and manners, of
laws and customs: in spite of things silently gone
out of mind, and things violently destroyed; the
Poet binds together by passion and knowledge the
vast empire of human society, as it is spread over
the whole earth, and over all time. The objects
of the Poet&#8217;s thoughts are everywhere; though
the eyes and senses of man are, it is true, his
favourite guides, yet he will follow wheresoever
he can find an atmosphere of sensation in which
to move his wings. Poetry is the first and last of all
knowledge&mdash;it is as immortal as the heart of man.
If the labours of Men of science should ever create
any material revolution, direct or indirect, in our
condition, and in the impressions which we
habitually receive, the Poet will sleep then no
more than at present; he will be ready to follow
the steps of the Man of science, not only in those
general indirect effects, but he will be at his side,
carrying sensation into the midst of the objects
of the science itself. The remotest discoveries of
the Chemist, the Botanist, or Mineralogist, will
be as proper objects of the Poet&#8217;s art as any upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
which it can be employed, if the time should ever
come when these things shall be familiar to us, and
the relations under which they are contemplated
by the followers of these respective sciences shall
be manifestly and palpably material to us as
enjoying and suffering beings. If the time should
ever come when what is now called science, thus
familiarized to men, shall be ready to put on, as
it were, a form of flesh and blood, the Poet will
lend his divine spirit to aid the transfiguration,
and will welcome the Being thus produced, as
a dear and genuine inmate of the household of
man.&mdash;It is not, then, to be supposed that any
one, who holds that sublime notion of Poetry
which I have attempted to convey, will break in
upon the sanctity and truth of his pictures by
transitory and accidental ornaments, and endeavour
to excite admiration of himself by arts,
the necessity of which must manifestly depend
upon the assumed meanness of his subject.</p>

<p>What has been thus far said applies to Poetry
in general; but especially to those parts of
composition where the Poet speaks through the
mouths of his characters; and upon this point
it appears to authorize the conclusion that there
are few persons of good sense, who would not
allow that the dramatic parts of composition are
defective, in proportion as they deviate from the
real language of nature, and are coloured by
a diction of the Poet&#8217;s own, either peculiar to him
as an individual Poet or belonging simply to Poets
in general; to a body of men who, from the circumstance
of their compositions being in metre,
it is expected will employ a particular language.</p>

<p>It is not, then, in the dramatic parts of composition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
that we look for this distinction of
language; but still it may be proper and necessary
where the Poet speaks to us in his own person
and character. To this I answer by referring the
Reader to the description before given of a Poet.
Among the qualities there enumerated as principally
conducing to form a Poet, is implied nothing
differing in kind from other men, but only in
degree. The sum of what was said is, that the
Poet is chiefly distinguished from other men by
a greater promptness to think and feel without
immediate external excitement, and a greater
power in expressing such thoughts and feelings
as are produced in him in that manner. But
these passions and thoughts and feelings are the
general passions and thoughts and feelings of men.
And with what are they connected? Undoubtedly
with our moral sentiments and animal sensations,
and with the causes which excite these; with the
operations of the elements, and the appearances
of the visible universe; with storm and sunshine,
with the revolutions of the seasons, with cold and
heat, with loss of friends and kindred, with injuries
and resentments, gratitude and hope, with fear and
sorrow. These, and the like, are the sensations
and objects which the Poet describes, as they are
the sensations of other men, and the objects which
interest them. The Poet thinks and feels in the
spirit of human passions. How, then, can his
language differ in any material degree from that
of all other men who feel vividly and see clearly?
It might be <i>proved</i> that it is impossible. But
supposing that this were not the case, the Poet
might then be allowed to use a peculiar language
when expressing his feelings for his own gratification,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
or that of men like himself. But Poets do
not write for Poets alone, but for men. Unless
therefore we are advocates for that admiration
which subsists upon ignorance, and that pleasure
which arises from hearing what we do not understand,
the Poet must descend from this supposed
height; and, in order to excite rational sympathy,
he must express himself as other men express
themselves. To this it may be added, that while
he is only selecting from the real language of men,
or, which amounts to the same thing, composing
accurately in the spirit of such selection, he is
treading upon safe ground, and we know what we
are to expect from him. Our feelings are the same
with respect to metre; for, as it may be proper
to remind the Reader, the distinction of metre is
regular and uniform, and not, like that which is
produced by what is usually called <small>POETIC DICTION</small>,
arbitrary, and subject to infinite caprices upon
which no calculation whatever can be made.
In the one case, the Reader is utterly at the mercy
of the Poet, respecting what imagery or diction
he may choose to connect with the passion;
whereas, in the other, the metre obeys certain
laws, to which the Poet and Reader both willingly
submit because they are certain, and because no
interference is made by them with the passion,
but such as the concurring testimony of ages has
shown to heighten and improve the pleasure
which co-exists with it.</p>

<p>It will now be proper to answer an obvious
question, namely, Why, professing these opinions,
have I written in verse? To this, in addition to
such answer as is included in what has been
already said, I reply, in the first place, Because,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
however I may have restricted myself, there is
still left open to me what confessedly constitutes
the most valuable object of all writing, whether
in prose or verse; the great and universal passions
of men, the most general and interesting of their
occupations, and the entire world of nature before
me&mdash;to supply endless combinations of forms and
imagery. Now, supposing for a moment that
whatever is interesting in these objects may be as
vividly described in prose, why should I be condemned
for attempting to superadd to such
description the charm which, by the consent of
all nations, is acknowledged to exist in metrical
language? To this, by such as are yet unconvinced,
it may be answered that a very small part of the
pleasure given by Poetry depends upon the metre,
and that it is injudicious to write in metre,
unless it be accompanied with the other artificial
distinctions of style with which metre is usually
accompanied, and that, by such deviation, more will
be lost from the shock which will thereby be given
to the Reader&#8217;s associations than will be counterbalanced
by any pleasure which he can derive
from the general power of numbers. In answer to
those who still contend for the necessity of accompanying
metre with certain appropriate colours
of style in order to the accomplishment of its
appropriate end, and who also, in my opinion,
greatly underrate the power of metre in itself, it
might, perhaps, as far as relates to these Volumes,
have been almost sufficient to observe, that poems
are extant, written upon more humble subjects,
and in a still more naked and simple style, which
have continued to give pleasure from generation
to generation. Now, if nakedness and simplicity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
be a defect, the fact here mentioned affords
a strong presumption that poems somewhat less
naked and simple are capable of affording pleasure
at the present day; and, what I wished <i>chiefly</i>
to attempt, at present, was to justify myself for
having written under the impression of this belief.</p>

<p>But various causes might be pointed out why,
when the style is manly, and the subject of some
importance, words metrically arranged will long
continue to impart such a pleasure to mankind
as he who proves the extent of that pleasure will
be desirous to impart. The end of Poetry is to
produce excitement in co-existence with an
overbalance of pleasure; but, by the supposition,
excitement is an unusual and irregular state of
the mind; ideas and feelings do not, in that
state, succeed each other in accustomed order.
If the words, however, by which this excitement
is produced be in themselves powerful, or the
images and feelings have an undue proportion of
pain connected with them, there is some danger
that the excitement may be carried beyond its
proper bounds. Now the co-presence of something
regular, something to which the mind has been
accustomed in various moods and in a less excited
state, cannot but have great efficacy in tempering
and restraining the passion by an intertexture of
ordinary feeling, and of feeling not strictly and
necessarily connected with the passion. This is
unquestionably true; and hence, though the
opinion will at first appear paradoxical, from the
tendency of metre to divest language, in a certain
degree, of its reality, and thus to throw a sort of
half-consciousness of unsubstantial existence over
the whole composition, there can be little doubt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
but that more pathetic situations and sentiments,
that is, those which have a greater proportion of
pain connected with them, may be endured in
metrical composition, especially in rhyme, than in
prose. The metre of the old ballads is very artless;
yet they contain many passages which would
illustrate this opinion; and, I hope, if the following
Poems be attentively perused, similar instances
will be found in them. This opinion may be
further illustrated by appealing to the Reader&#8217;s
own experience of the reluctance with which he
comes to the re-perusal of the distressful parts
of <i>Clarissa Harlowe</i>, or the <i>Gamester</i>; while
Shakespeare&#8217;s writings, in the most pathetic scenes,
never act upon us, as pathetic, beyond the bounds
of pleasure&mdash;an effect which, in a much greater
degree than might at first be imagined, is to be
ascribed to small, but continual and regular
impulses of pleasurable surprise from the metrical
arrangement.&mdash;On the other hand (what it must
be allowed will much more frequently happen) if
the Poet&#8217;s words should be incommensurate with
the passion, and inadequate to raise the Reader
to a height of desirable excitement, then (unless
the Poet&#8217;s choice of his metre has been grossly
injudicious), in the feelings of pleasure which the
Reader has been accustomed to connect with
metre in general, and in the feeling, whether
cheerful or melancholy, which he has been accustomed
to connect with that particular movement
of metre, there will be found something which will
greatly contribute to impart passion to the words,
and to effect the complex end which the Poet
proposes to himself.</p>

<p>If I had undertaken a <small>SYSTEMATIC</small> defence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the theory here maintained, it would have been
my duty to develop the various causes upon
which the pleasure received from metrical language
depends. Among the chief of these causes is to be
reckoned a principle which must be well known
to those who have made any of the Arts the object
of accurate reflection; namely, the pleasure which
the mind derives from the perception of similitude
in dissimilitude. This principle is the great spring
of the activity of our minds, and their chief feeder.
From this principle the direction of the sexual
appetite, and all the passions connected with it,
take their origin: it is the life of our ordinary
conversation; and upon the accuracy with which
similitude in dissimilitude, and dissimilitude in
similitude are perceived, depend our taste and
our moral feelings. It would not be a useless
employment to apply this principle to the consideration
of metre, and to show that metre is hence
enabled to afford much pleasure, and to point out
in what manner that pleasure is produced. But
my limits will not permit me to enter upon this
subject, and I must content myself with a general
summary.</p>

<p>I have said that poetry is the spontaneous
overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin
from emotion recollected in tranquillity: the
emotion is contemplated till, by a species of reaction,
the tranquillity gradually disappears, and an
emotion, kindred to that which was before the
subject of contemplation, is gradually produced,
and does itself actually exist in the mind. In
this mood successful composition generally begins,
and in a mood similar to this it is carried on;
but the emotion, of whatever kind, and in whatever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
degree, from various causes, is qualified by
various pleasures, so that in describing any
passions whatsoever, which are voluntarily described,
the mind will, upon the whole, be in
a state of enjoyment. If Nature be thus cautious
to preserve in a state of enjoyment a being so
employed, the Poet ought to profit by the lesson
held forth to him, and ought especially to take
care, that, whatever passions he communicates to
his Reader, those passions, if his Reader&#8217;s mind
be sound and vigorous, should always be accompanied
with an overbalance of pleasure. Now
the music of harmonious metrical language, the
sense of difficulty overcome, and the blind
association of pleasure which has been previously
received from works of rhyme or metre of the
same or similar construction, an indistinct perception
perpetually renewed of language closely
resembling that of real life, and yet, in the
circumstance of metre, differing from it so widely&mdash;all
these imperceptibly make up a complex
feeling of delight, which is of the most important
use in tempering the painful feeling always found
intermingled with powerful descriptions of the
deeper passions. This effect is always produced
in pathetic and impassioned poetry; while, in
lighter compositions, the ease and gracefulness
with which the Poet manages his numbers are
themselves confessedly a principal source of the
gratification of the Reader. All that it is <i>necessary</i>
to say, however, upon this subject, may be effected
by affirming, what few persons will deny, that, of
two descriptions, either of passions, manners, or
characters, each of them equally well executed,
the one in prose and the other in verse, the verse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
will be read a hundred times where the prose is
read once.</p>

<p>Having thus explained a few of my reasons for
writing in verse, and why I have chosen subjects
from common life, and endeavoured to bring my
language near to the real language of men, if I
have been too minute in pleading my own cause,
I have at the same time been treating a subject
of general interest; and for this reason a few
words shall be added with reference solely to
these particular poems, and to some defects which
will probably be found in them. I am sensible
that my associations must have sometimes been
particular instead of general, and that, consequently,
giving to things a false importance, I may
have sometimes written upon unworthy subjects;
but I am less apprehensive on this account, than
that my language may frequently have suffered
from those arbitrary connexions of feelings and
ideas with particular words and phrases, from
which no man can altogether protect himself.
Hence I have no doubt, that, in some instances,
feelings, even of the ludicrous, may be given to
my Readers by expressions which appeared to
me tender and pathetic. Such faulty expressions,
were I convinced they were faulty at present, and
that they must necessarily continue to be so,
I would willingly take all reasonable pains to
correct. But it is dangerous to make these
alterations on the simple authority of a few
individuals, or even of certain classes of men;
for where the understanding of an Author is not
convinced, or his feelings altered, this cannot be
done without great injury to himself: for his own
feelings are his stay and support; and, if he set<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
them aside in one instance, he may be induced to
repeat this act till his mind shall lose all confidence
in itself, and become utterly debilitated. To this
it may be added, that the critic ought never to
forget that he is himself exposed to the same errors
as the Poet, and, perhaps, in a much greater degree:
for there can be no presumption in saying of most
readers, that it is not probable they will be so well
acquainted with the various stages of meaning
through which words have passed, or with the
fickleness or stability of the relations of particular
ideas to each other; and, above all, since they are
so much less interested in the subject, they may
decide lightly and carelessly.</p>

<p>Long as the Reader has been detained, I hope
he will permit me to caution him against a mode
of false criticism which has been applied to Poetry,
in which the language closely resembles that of life
and nature. Such verses have been triumphed
over in parodies, of which Dr. Johnson&#8217;s stanza is
a fair specimen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I put my hat upon my head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And walked into the Strand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there I met another man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose hat was in his hand.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Immediately under these lines let us place one
of the most justly-admired stanzas of the &#8216;Babes
in the Wood.&#8217;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">These pretty Babes with hand in hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went wandering up and down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never more they saw the Man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Approaching from the Town.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In both these stanzas the words, and the order
of the words, in no respect differ from the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
unimpassioned conversation. There are words
in both, for example, &#8216;the Strand&#8217;, and &#8216;the
Town&#8217;, connected with none but the most familiar
ideas; yet the one stanza we admit as admirable,
and the other as a fair example of the superlatively
contemptible. Whence arises this difference?
Not from the metre, not from the language, not
from the order of the words; but the <i>matter</i>
expressed in Dr. Johnson&#8217;s stanza is contemptible.
The proper method of treating trivial and simple
verses, to which Dr. Johnson&#8217;s stanza would be
a fair parallelism, is not to say, this is a bad kind
of poetry, or, this is not poetry; but, this wants
sense; it is neither interesting in itself, nor can
<i>lead</i> to anything interesting; the images neither
originate in that sane state of feeling, which arises
out of thought, nor can excite thought or feeling
in the Reader. This is the only sensible manner
of dealing with such verses. Why trouble yourself
about the species till you have previously decided
upon the genus? Why take pains to prove that
an ape is not a Newton, when it is self-evident
that he is not a man?</p>

<p>One request I must make of my reader, which
is, that in judging these Poems he would decide
by his own feelings genuinely, and not by reflection
upon what will probably be the judgement of
others. How common is it to hear a person say,
I myself do not object to this style of composition,
or this or that expression, but, to such and such
classes of people it will appear mean or ludicrous!
This mode of criticism, so destructive of all sound
unadulterated judgement, is almost universal:
let the Reader then abide, independently, by his
own feelings, and, if he finds himself affected, let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
him not suffer such conjectures to interfere with
his pleasure.</p>

<p>If an Author, by any single composition, has
impressed us with respect for his talents, it is
useful to consider this as affording a presumption,
that on other occasions where we have been
displeased, he, nevertheless, may not have written
ill or absurdly; and further, to give him so much
credit for this one composition as may induce us
to review what has displeased us, with more care
than we should otherwise have bestowed upon it.
This is not only an act of justice, but, in our
decisions upon poetry especially, may conduce,
in a high degree, to the improvement of our own
taste; for an <i>accurate</i> taste in poetry, and in
all the other arts, as Sir Joshua Reynolds has
observed, is an <i>acquired</i> talent, which can only
be produced by thought and a long-continued
intercourse with the best models of composition.
This is mentioned, not with so ridiculous a purpose
as to prevent the most inexperienced Reader from
judging for himself, (I have already said that I wish
him to judge for himself;) but merely to temper the
rashness of decision, and to suggest, that, if Poetry
be a subject on which much time has not been
bestowed, the judgement may be erroneous; and
that, in many cases, it necessarily will be so.</p>

<p>Nothing would, I know, have so effectually
contributed to further the end which I have in
view, as to have shown of what kind the pleasure
is, and how that pleasure is produced, which is
confessedly produced by metrical composition
essentially different from that which I have here
endeavoured to recommend: for the Reader will
say that he has been pleased by such composition;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and what more can be done for him? The power
of any art is limited; and he will suspect, that,
if it be proposed to furnish him with new friends,
that can be only upon condition of his abandoning
his old friends. Besides, as I have said, the Reader
is himself conscious of the pleasure which he has
received from such composition, composition to
which he has peculiarly attached the endearing
name of Poetry; and all men feel an habitual
gratitude, and something of an honourable bigotry,
for the objects which have long continued to please
them: we not only wish to be pleased, but to be
pleased in that particular way in which we have
Been accustomed to be pleased. There is in these
feelings enough to resist a host of arguments; and
I should be the less able to combat them successfully,
as I am willing to allow, that, in order entirely
to enjoy the Poetry which I am recommending, it
would be necessary to give up much of what is
ordinarily enjoyed. But, would my limits have
permitted me to point out how this pleasure is
produced, many obstacles might have been removed,
and the Reader assisted in perceiving that
the powers of language are not so limited as he may
suppose; and that it is possible for poetry to give
other enjoyments, of a purer, more lasting, and
more exquisite nature. This part of the subject
has not been altogether neglected, but it has not
been so much my present aim to prove, that the
interest excited by some other kinds of poetry is
less vivid, and less worthy of the nobler powers of
the mind, as to offer reasons for presuming, that
if my purpose were fulfilled, a species of poetry
would be produced, which is genuine poetry; in its
nature well adapted to interest mankind permanently,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and likewise important in the multiplicity
and quality of its moral relations.</p>

<p>From what has been said, and from a perusal of
the Poems, the Reader will be able clearly to perceive
the object which I had in view: he will
determine how far it has been attained; and, what
is a much more important question, whether it be
worth attaining: and upon the decision of these
two questions will rest my claim to the approbation
of the Public.</p>


<h3 style="padding-top: 1em">APPENDIX</h3>

<h4>ON POETIC DICTION</h4>

<p>Perhaps, as I have no right to expect that attentive
perusal, without which, confined, as I have
been, to the narrow limits of a preface, my meaning
cannot be thoroughly understood, I am anxious to
give an exact notion of the sense in which the
phrase poetic diction has been used; and for this
purpose, a few words shall here be added, concerning
the origin and characteristics of the phraseology,
which I have condemned under that name.</p>

<p>The earliest poets of all nations generally wrote
from passion excited by real events; they wrote
naturally, and as men: feeling powerfully as they
did, their language was daring, and figurative. In
succeeding times, Poets, and Men ambitious of the
fame of Poets, perceiving the influence of such language,
and desirous of producing the same effect
without being animated by the same passion, set
themselves to a mechanical adoption of these
figures of speech, and made use of them, sometimes
with propriety, but much more frequently applied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
them to feelings and thoughts with which they had
no natural connexion whatsoever. A language
was thus insensibly produced, differing materially
from the real language of men in <i>any situation</i>.
The Reader or Hearer of this distorted language
found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of
mind: when affected by the genuine language of
passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual
state of mind also: in both cases he was willing
that his common judgement and understanding
should be laid asleep, and he had no instinctive and
infallible perception of the true to make him reject
the false; the one served as a passport for the
other. The emotion was in both cases delightful,
and no wonder if he confounded the one with the
other, and believed them both to be produced
by the same, or similar causes. Besides, the Poet
spake to him in the character of a man to be looked
up to, a man of genius and authority. Thus, and
from a variety of other causes, this distorted language
was received with admiration; and Poets,
it is probable, who had before contented themselves
for the most part with misapplying only
expressions which at first had been dictated by
real passion, carried the abuse still further, and
introduced phrases composed apparently in the
spirit of the original figurative language of passion,
yet altogether of their own invention, and characterized
by various degrees of wanton deviation
from good sense and nature.</p>

<p>It is indeed true, that the language of the earliest
Poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary
language, because it was the language of extraordinary
occasions; but it was really spoken by
men, language which the Poet himself had uttered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
when he had been affected by the events which he
described, or which he had heard uttered by
those around him. To this language it is probable
that metre of some sort or other was early superadded.
This separated the genuine language of
Poetry still further from common life, so that whoever
read or heard the poems of these earliest
Poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had
not been accustomed to be moved in real life, and
by causes manifestly different from those which
acted upon him in real life. This was the great
temptation to all the corruptions which have followed:
under the protection of this feeling succeeding
Poets constructed a phraseology which had
one thing, it is true, in common with the genuine
language of poetry, namely, that it was not heard
in ordinary conversation; that it was unusual.
But the first Poets, as I have said, spake a language
which, though unusual, was still the language of
men. This circumstance, however, was disregarded
by their successors; they found that they
could please by easier means: they became proud
of modes of expression which they themselves had
invented, and which were uttered only by themselves.
In process of time metre became a symbol
or promise of this unusual language, and whoever
took upon him to write in metre, according as he
possessed more or less of true poetic genius,
introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology
into his compositions, and the true and the
false were inseparably interwoven until, the taste
of men becoming gradually perverted, this language
was received as a natural language: and at length,
by the influence of books upon men, did to a certain
degree really become so. Abuses of this kind were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
imported from one nation to another, and with the
progress of refinement this diction became daily
more and more corrupt, thrusting out of sight
the plain humanities of nature by a motley
masquerade of tricks, quaintnesses, hieroglyphics,
and enigmas.</p>

<p>It would not be uninteresting to point out the
causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant
and absurd diction. It depends upon a great
variety of causes, but upon none, perhaps, more
than its influence in impressing a notion of the
peculiarity and exaltation of the Poet&#8217;s character,
and in flattering the Reader&#8217;s self-love by bringing
him nearer to a sympathy with that character; an
effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary
habits of thinking, and thus assisting the Reader
to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of
mind in which if he does not find himself, he
imagines that he is <i>balked</i> of a peculiar enjoyment
which poetry can and ought to bestow.</p>

<p>The sonnet quoted from Gray, in the Preface,
except the lines printed in Italics, consists of little
else but this diction, though not of the worst kind;
and indeed, if one may be permitted to say so, it is
far too common in the best writers both ancient
and modern. Perhaps in no way, by positive example,
could more easily be given a notion of what
I mean by the phrase <i>poetic diction</i> than by referring
to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase
which we have of passages in the Old and
New Testament, and those passages as they exist
in our common Translation. See Pope&#8217;s &#8216;Messiah&#8217;
throughout; Prior&#8217;s &#8216;Did sweeter sounds adorn
my flowing tongue,&#8217; &amp;c. &amp;c. &#8216;Though I speak
with the tongues of men and of angels,&#8217; &amp;c. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>&amp;c.
1 Corinthians, chap. xiii. By way of immediate
example take the following of Dr. Johnson:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Turn on the prudent Ant thy heedless eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Observe her labours, Sluggard, and be wise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No stern command, no monitory voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prescribes her duties, or directs her choice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, timely provident, she hastes away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To snatch the blessings of a plenteous day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When fruitful Summer loads the teeming plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She crops the harvest, and she stores the grain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How long shall sloth usurp thy useless hours,<br /></span>

<p>From this hubbub of words pass to the original.
&#8216;Go to the Ant, thou Sluggard, consider her ways,

a little folding of the hands to sleep. So shall thy
poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want

<p>One more quotation, and I have done. It is

</div></div>

<p>This passage is quoted as an instance of three
different styles of composition. The first four
lines are poorly expressed; some Critics would call
the language prosaic; the fact is, it would be bad
prose, so bad, that it is scarcely worse in metre.
The epithet &#8216;church-going&#8217; applied to a bell, and
that by so chaste a writer as Cowper, is an instance
of the strange abuses which Poets have introduced
into their language, till they and their Readers
take them as matters of course, if they do not
single them out expressly as objects of admiration.
The two lines &#8216;Ne&#8217;er sighed at the sound&#8217;, &amp;c.,
are, in my opinion, an instance of the language
of passion wrested from its proper use, and, from
the mere circumstance of the composition being
in metre, applied upon an occasion that does not
justify such violent expressions; and I should
condemn the passage, though perhaps few Readers
will agree with me, as vicious poetic diction. The
last stanza is throughout admirably expressed: it
would be equally good whether in prose or verse,
except that the Reader has an exquisite pleasure
in seeing such natural language so naturally connected
with metre. The beauty of this stanza
tempts me to conclude with a principle which
ought never to be lost sight of, and which has been
my chief guide in all I have said,&mdash;namely, that in
works of <i>imagination and sentiment</i>, for of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
only have I been treating, in proportion as ideas
and feelings are valuable, whether the composition
be in prose or in verse, they require and exact one
and the same language. Metre is but adventitious
to composition, and the phraseology for which that
passport is necessary, even where it may be graceful
at all, will be little valued by the judicious.</p>

<h3>1772-1834</h3>

<h3>WORDSWORTH&#8217;S THEORY OF DICTION</h3>

<h4>[<i>Biographia Literaria</i>, chap. xvii, 1817]</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> far as Mr. Wordsworth in his preface contended,
and most ably contended, for a reformation
in our poetic diction, as far as he has evinced the
truth of passion, and the <i>dramatic</i> propriety of
those figures and metaphors in the original poets,
which, stripped of their justifying reasons, and converted
into mere artifices of connexion or ornament,
constitute the characteristic falsity in the poetic
style of the moderns; and as far as he has, with
equal acuteness and clearness, pointed out the
process by which this change was effected, and the
resemblances between that state into which the
reader&#8217;s mind is thrown by the pleasureable confusion
of thought from an unaccustomed train of
words and images; and that state which is induced
by the natural language of impassioned
feeling; he undertook a useful task, and deserves
all praise, both for the attempt and for the execution.
The provocations to this remonstrance in
behalf of truth and nature were still of perpetual
recurrence before and after the publication of this
preface. I cannot likewise but add, that the comparison
of such poems of merit, as have been given
to the public within the last ten or twelve years,
with the majority of those produced previously to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the appearance of that preface, leave no doubt on
my mind, that Mr. Wordsworth is fully justified in
believing his efforts to have been by no means
ineffectual. Not only in the verses of those who
have professed their admiration of his genius, but
even of those who have distinguished themselves
by hostility to his theory, and depreciation of his
writings, are the impressions of his principles
plainly visible. It is possible, that with these principles
others may have been blended, which are
not equally evident; and some which are unsteady
and subvertible from the narrowness or imperfection
of their basis. But it is more than possible,
that these errors of defect or exaggeration, by
kindling and feeding the controversy, may have
conduced not only to the wider propagation of the
accompanying truths, but that, by their frequent
presentation to the mind in an excited state, they
may have won for them a more permanent and
practical result. A man will borrow a part from
his opponent the more easily, if he feels himself
justified in continuing to reject a part. While
there remain important points in which he can still
feel himself in the right, in which he still finds firm
footing for continued resistance, he will gradually
adopt those opinions, which were the least remote
from his own convictions, as not less congruous
with his own theory than with that which he reprobates.
In like manner with a kind of instinctive
prudence, he will abandon by little and little his
weakest posts, till at length he seems to forget that
they had ever belonged to him, or affects to consider
them at most as accidental and &#8216;petty
annexments&#8217;, the removal of which leaves the
citadel unhurt and unendangered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>My own differences from certain supposed parts
of Mr. Wordsworth&#8217;s theory ground themselves on
the assumption, that his words had been rightly
interpreted, as purporting that the proper diction
for poetry in general consists altogether in a language
taken, with due exceptions, from the mouths
of men in real life, a language which actually constitutes
the natural conversation of men under the
influence of natural feelings. My objection is, first,
that in any sense this rule is applicable only to
certain classes of poetry; secondly, that even to
these classes it is not applicable, except in such a
sense, as hath never by any one (as far as I know
or have read) been denied or doubted; and lastly,
that as far as, and in that degree in which it is
practicable, yet as a rule it is useless, if not injurious,
and therefore either need not, or ought not to be
practised. The poet informs his reader that he
had generally chosen low and rustic life; but not
<i>as</i> low and rustic, or in order to repeat that pleasure
of doubtful moral effect, which persons of elevated
rank and of superior refinement oftentimes derive
from a happy imitation of the rude unpolished
manners and discourse of their inferiors. For the
pleasure so derived may be traced to three exciting
causes. The first is the naturalness, in fact, of the
things represented. The second is the apparent
naturalness of the representation, as raised and
qualified by an imperceptible infusion of the
author&#8217;s own knowledge and talent, which infusion
does, indeed, constitute it an imitation as distinguished
from a mere copy. The third cause may
be found in the reader&#8217;s conscious feeling of his
superiority awakened by the contrast presented
to him; even as for the same purpose the kings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and great barons of yore retained sometimes actual
clowns and fools, but more frequently shrewd and
witty fellows in that character. These, however,
were not Mr. Wordsworth&#8217;s objects. He chose low
and rustic life, &#8216;because in that condition the
essential passions of the heart find a better soil, in
which they can attain their maturity, are less under
restraint, and speak a plainer and more emphatic
language; because in that condition of life our
elementary feelings coexist in a state of greater
simplicity, and consequently may be more accurately
contemplated, and more forcibly communicated;
because the manners of rural life germinate
from those elementary feelings; and from the
necessary character of rural occupations are more
easily comprehended, and are more durable; and
lastly, because in that condition the passions of
men are incorporated with the beautiful and permanent
forms of nature.&#8217;</p>

<p>Now it is clear to me, that in the most interesting
of the poems, in which the author is more or less
dramatic, as the <i>Brothers</i>, <i>Michael</i>, <i>Ruth</i>, the <i>Mad
Mother</i>, &amp;c., the persons introduced are by no
means taken from low or rustic life in the common
acceptation of those words; and it is not less
clear, that the sentiments and language, as far as
they can be conceived to have been really transferred
from the minds and conversation of such
persons, are attributable to causes and circumstances
not necessarily connected with &#8216;their occupations
and abode&#8217;. The thoughts, feelings, language,
and manners of the shepherd-farmers in the
vales of Cumberland and Westmoreland, as far as
they are actually adopted in those poems, may be
accounted for from causes, which will and do produce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the same results in every state of life, whether
in town or country. As the two principal I rank
that <small>INDEPENDENCE</small>, which raises a man above
servitude, or daily toil for the profit of others, yet
not above the necessity of industry and a frugal
simplicity of domestic life; and the accompanying
unambitious, but solid and religious, <small>EDUCATION</small>,
which has rendered few books familiar, but the
Bible, and the liturgy or hymnbook. To the latter
cause, indeed, which is so far accidental, that it is
the blessing of particular countries and a particular
age, not the product of particular places or employments,
the poet owes the show of probability, that
his personages might really feel, think, and talk
with any tolerable resemblance to his representation.
It is an excellent remark of Dr. Henry More&#8217;s
that &#8216;a man of confined education, but of good parts,
by constant reading of the Bible will naturally
form a more winning and commanding rhetoric
than those that are learned: the intermixture of
tongues and of artificial phrases debasing their
style&#8217;.</p>

<p>It is, moreover, to be considered that to the
formation of healthy feelings, and a reflecting mind,
negations involve impediments not less formidable
than sophistication and vicious intermixture. I am
convinced, that for the human soul to prosper
in rustic life a certain vantage-ground is pre-requisite.
It is not every man that is likely to be
improved by a country life or by country labours.
Education, or original sensibility, or both, must
pre-exist, if the changes, forms, and incidents of
nature are to prove a sufficient stimulant. And
where these are not sufficient, the mind contracts
and hardens by want of stimulants: and the man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
becomes selfish, sensual, gross, and hard-hearted.
Let the management of the <small>POOR LAWS</small> in Liverpool,
Manchester, or Bristol be compared with the
ordinary dispensation of the poor rates in agricultural
villages, where the farmers are the overseers
and guardians of the poor. If my own experience
have not been particularly unfortunate, as well as
that of the many respectable country clergymen
with whom I have conversed on the subject, the
result would engender more than scepticism concerning
the desirable influences of low and rustic
life in and for itself. Whatever may be concluded
on the other side, from the stronger local attachments
and enterprising spirit of the Swiss, and
other mountaineers, applies to a particular mode
of pastoral life, under forms of property that permit
and beget manners truly republican, not to
rustic life in general, or to the absence of artificial
cultivation. On the contrary the mountaineers,
whose manners have been so often eulogized, are
in general better educated and greater readers
than men of equal rank elsewhere. But where this
is not the case, as among the peasantry of North
Wales, the ancient mountains, with all their terrors
and all their glories, are pictures to the blind, and
music to the deaf.</p>

<p>I should not have entered so much into detail
upon this passage, but here seems to be the point,
to which all the lines of difference converge as to
their source and centre;&mdash;I mean, as far as, and in
whatever respect, my poetic creed does differ from
the doctrines promulgated in this preface. I adopt
with full faith the principle of Aristotle, that poetry,
as poetry, is essentially ideal, that it avoids and
excludes all accident; that its apparent individualities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of rank, character, or occupation must be
representative of a class; and that the persons of
poetry must be clothed with generic attributes,
with the common attributes of the class: not with
such as one gifted individual might possibly possess,
but such as from his situation it is most probable
beforehand that he would possess. If my premises
are right and my deductions legitimate, it follows
that there can be no poetic medium between the
swains of Theocritus and those of an imaginary
golden age.</p>

<p>The characters of the vicar and the shepherd-mariner
in the poem of <i>The Brothers</i>, that of the
shepherd of Green-head Ghyll in the <i>Michael</i>,
have all the verisimilitude and representative
quality, that the purposes of poetry can require.
They are persons of a known and abiding class, and
their manners and sentiments the natural product
of circumstances common to the class. Take
Michael for instance:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">An old man stout of heart, and strong of limb:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bodily frame had been from youth to age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of an unusual strength: his mind was keen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intense, and frugal, apt for all affairs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his shepherd&#8217;s calling he was prompt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And watchful more than ordinary men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence he had learned the meaning of all winds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of blasts of every tone; and oftentimes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When others heeded not, he heard the South<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make subterraneous music, like the noise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of bagpipers on distant Highland hills.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shepherd, at such warning, of his flock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bethought him, and he to himself would say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winds are now devising work for me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And truly at all times the storm, that drives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The traveller to a shelter, summon&#8217;d him<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And grossly that man errs, who should suppose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the green valleys, and the streams and rocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were things indifferent to the shepherd&#8217;s thoughts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fields, where with chearful spirits he had breath&#8217;d<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The common air; the hills, which he so oft<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So many incidents upon his mind<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A pleasureable feeling of blind love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pleasure which there is in life itself.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">On the other hand, in the poems which are pitched
at a lower note, as the <i>Harry Gill</i>, <i>Idiot Boy</i>, the
feelings are those of human nature in general;
though the poet has judiciously laid the scene in
the country, in order to place himself in the vicinity
of interesting images, without the necessity of
ascribing a sentimental perception of their beauty
to the persons of his drama. In <i>The Idiot Boy</i>,
indeed, the mother&#8217;s character is not so much a
real and native product of a &#8216;situation where the
essential passions of the heart find a better soil, in
which they can attain their maturity and speak
a plainer and more emphatic language&#8217;, as it is an
impersonation of an instinct abandoned by judgement.
Hence the two following charges seem to
me not wholly groundless: at least, they are the
only plausible objections, which I have heard to
that fine poem. The one is, that the author has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
not, in the poem itself, taken sufficient care to preclude
from the reader&#8217;s fancy the disgusting images
of ordinary morbid idiocy, which yet it was by no
means his intention to represent. He has even
by the &#8216;burr, burr, burr&#8217;, uncounteracted by any
preceding description of the boy&#8217;s beauty, assisted
in recalling them. The other is, that the idiocy
of the boy is so evenly balanced by the folly of the
mother, as to present to the general reader rather
a laughable burlesque on the blindness of anile
dotage, than an analytic display of maternal affection
in its ordinary workings.</p>

<p>In <i>The Thorn</i>, the poet himself acknowledges
in a note the necessity of an introductory poem,
in which he should have portrayed the character
of the person from whom the words of the poem
are supposed to proceed: a superstitious man
moderately imaginative, of slow faculties and deep
feelings, &#8216;a captain of a small trading vessel, for
example, who, being past the middle age of life,
had retired upon an annuity, or small independent
income, to some village or country town of which
he was not a native, or in which he had not been
accustomed to live. Such men having nothing to
do become credulous and talkative from indolence&#8217;.
But in a poem, still more in a lyric poem&mdash;and the
Nurse in Shakespeare&#8217;s <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> alone
prevents me from extending the remark even to
dramatic poetry, if indeed even the Nurse itself
can be deemed altogether a case in point&mdash;it is not
possible to imitate truly a dull and garrulous discourser,
without repeating the effects of dullness
and garrulity. However this may be, I dare assert,
that the parts&mdash;(and these form the far larger portion
of the whole)&mdash;which might as well or still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
better have proceeded from the poet&#8217;s own imagination,
and have been spoken in his own character,
are those which have given, and which will continue
to give, universal delight; and that the
passages exclusively appropriate to the supposed
narrator, such as the last couplet of the third
stanza;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the seven last lines of the tenth;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>the five following stanzas, with the exception of
the four admirable lines at the commencement of
the fourteenth, are felt by many unprejudiced and
unsophisticated hearts, as sudden and unpleasant
sinkings from the height to which the poet had
previously lifted them, and to which he again re-elevates
both himself and his reader.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p><p>If then I am compelled to doubt the theory, by
which the choice of characters was to be directed,
not only <i>&agrave; priori</i>, from grounds of reason, but both
from the few instances in which the poet himself
need be supposed to have been governed by it, and
from the comparative inferiority of those instances;
still more must I hesitate in my assent to the sentence
which immediately follows the former citation;
and which I can neither admit as particular
fact, nor as general rule. &#8216;The language, too, of
these men is adopted (purified indeed from what
appear to be its real defects, from all lasting and
rational causes of dislike or disgust) because such
men hourly communicate with the best objects
from which the best part of language is originally
derived; and because, from their rank in society
and the sameness and narrow circle of their intercourse,
being less under the action of social vanity,
they convey their feelings and notions in simple
and unelaborated expressions.&#8217; To this I reply;
that a rustic&#8217;s language, purified from all provincialism
and grossness, and so far reconstructed as
to be made consistent with the rules of grammar&mdash;(which
are in essence no other than the laws of
universal logic, applied to psychological materials)&mdash;will
not differ from the language of any other
man of common sense, however learned or refined
he may be, except as far as the notions, which the
rustic has to convey, are fewer and more indiscriminate.
This will become still clearer, if we add
the consideration&mdash;(equally important though less
obvious)&mdash;that the rustic, from the more imperfect
development of his faculties, and from the lower
state of their cultivation, aims almost solely to
convey insulated facts, either those of his scanty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
experience or his traditional belief; while the educated
man chiefly seeks to discover and express
those connexions of things, or those relative bearings
of fact to fact, from which some more or less general
law is deducible. For facts are valuable to a wise
man, chiefly as they lead to the discovery of the
indwelling law, which is the true being of things,
the sole solution of their modes of existence, and
in the knowledge of which consists our dignity and
our power.</p>

<p>As little can I agree with the assertion, that from
the objects with which the rustic hourly communicates
the best part of language is formed. For
first, if to communicate with an object implies such
an acquaintance with it, as renders it capable of
being discriminately reflected on; the distinct
knowledge of an uneducated rustic would furnish
a very scanty vocabulary. The few things and
modes of action requisite for his bodily conveniences
would alone be individualized; while all the
rest of nature would be expressed by a small
number of confused general terms. Secondly, I
deny that the words and combinations of words
derived from the objects, with which the rustic is
familiar, whether with distinct or confused knowledge,
can be justly said to form the best part of
language. It is more than probable, that many
classes of the brute creation possess discriminating
sounds, by which they can convey to each other
notices of such objects as concern their food,
shelter, or safety. Yet we hesitate to call the
aggregate of such sounds a language, otherwise
than metaphorically. The best part of human
language, properly so called, is derived from reflection
on the acts of the mind itself. It is formed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
by a voluntary appropriation of fixed symbols to
internal acts, to processes and results of imagination,
the greater part of which have no place in
the consciousness of uneducated man; though in
civilized society, by imitation and passive remembrance
of what they hear from their religious instructors
and other superiors, the most uneducated
share in the harvest which they neither sowed nor
reaped. If the history of the phrases in hourly
currency among our peasants were traced, a person
not previously aware of the fact would be surprised
at finding so large a number, which three or four
centuries ago were the exclusive property of the
universities and the schools; and, at the commencement
of the Reformation, had been transferred
from the school to the pulpit, and thus
gradually passed into common life. The extreme
difficulty, and often the impossibility, of finding
words for the simplest moral and intellectual processes
of the languages of uncivilized tribes has
proved perhaps the weightiest obstacle to the progress
of our most zealous and adroit missionaries.
Yet these tribes are surrounded by the same nature
as our peasants are; but in still more impressive
forms; and they are, moreover, obliged to particularize
many more of them. When, therefore,
Mr. Wordsworth adds, &#8216;accordingly, such a language&#8217;&mdash;(meaning,
as before, the language of
rustic life purified from provincialism)&mdash;&#8216;arising
out of repeated experience and regular feelings, is
a more permanent, and a far more philosophical
language, than that which is frequently substituted
for it by poets, who think that they are conferring
honour upon themselves and their art in proportion
as they indulge in arbitrary and capricious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
habits of expression;&#8217; it may be answered, that
the language, which he has in view, can be attributed
to rustics with no greater right, than the
style of Hooker or Bacon to Tom Brown or Sir
Roger L&#8217;Estrange. Doubtless, if what is peculiar
to each were omitted in each, the result must needs
be the same. Further, that the poet, who uses an
illogical diction, or a style fitted to excite only
the low and changeable pleasure of wonder by
means of groundless novelty, substitutes a language
of folly and vanity, not for that of the rustic,
but for that of good sense and natural feeling.</p>

<p>Here let me be permitted to remind the reader,
that the positions, which I controvert, are contained
in the sentences&mdash;&#8216;<i>a selection of the</i> <small>REAL</small>
<i>language of men</i>&#8217;;&mdash;&#8216;<i>the language of these men</i>&#8217;
(i. e. men in low and rustic life) &#8216;<i>I propose to myself
to imitate, and, as far as is possible, to adopt the very
language of men.</i>&#8217; &#8216;<i>Between the language of prose
and that of metrical composition, there neither is, nor
can be, any essential difference.</i>&#8217; It is against these
exclusively that my opposition is directed.</p>

<p>I object, in the very first instance, to an equivocation
in the use of the word &#8216;real&#8217;. Every man&#8217;s
language varies, according to the extent of his
knowledge, the activity of his faculties, and the
depth or quickness of his feelings. Every man&#8217;s
language has, first, its individualities; secondly,
the common properties of the class to which he
belongs; and thirdly, words and phrases of universal
use. The language of Hooker, Bacon, Bishop
Taylor, and Burke differs from the common language
of the learned class only by the superior number
and novelty of the thoughts and relations which
they had to convey. The language of Algernon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Sidney differs not at all from that, which every
well-educated gentleman would wish to write, and
(with due allowance for the undeliberateness, and
less connected train, of thinking natural and
proper to conversation) such as he would wish to
talk. Neither one nor the other differ half so much
from the general language of cultivated society,
as the language of Mr. Wordsworth&#8217;s homeliest
composition differs from that of a common peasant.
For &#8216;real&#8217; therefore, we must substitute ordinary,
or <i>lingua communis</i>. And this, we have proved,
is no more to be found in the phraseology of low
and rustic life than in that of any other class.
Omit the peculiarities of each and the result of
course must be common to all. And assuredly the
omissions and changes to be made in the language
of rustics, before it could be transferred to any
species of poem, except the drama or other professed
imitation, are at least as numerous and
weighty, as would be required in adapting to the
same purpose the ordinary language of tradesmen
and manufacturers. Not to mention, that the
language so highly extolled by Mr. Wordsworth
varies in every county, nay in every village,
according to the accidental character of the clergyman,
the existence or non-existence of schools; or
even, perhaps, as the exciseman, publican, and
barber happen to be, or not to be, zealous politicians,
and readers of the weekly newspaper <i>pro bono
publico</i>. Anterior to cultivation the <i>lingua communis</i>
of every country, as Dante has well observed,
exists everywhere in parts, and nowhere as a
whole.</p>

<p>Neither is the case rendered at all more tenable
by the addition of the words, <i>in a state of excitement</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
For the nature of a man&#8217;s words, where he
is strongly affected by joy, grief, or anger, must
necessarily depend on the number and quality of
the general truths, conceptions and images, and of
the words expressing them, with which his mind
had been previously stored. For the property of
passion is not to create; but to set in increased
activity. At least, whatever new connexions of
thoughts or images, or (which is equally, if not
more than equally, the appropriate effect of strong
excitement) whatever generalizations of truth or
experience the heat of passion may produce; yet the
terms of their conveyance must have pre-existed
in his former conversations, and are only collected
and crowded together by the unusual stimulation.
It is indeed very possible to adopt in a poem the
unmeaning repetitions, habitual phrases, and other
blank counters, which an unfurnished or confused
understanding interposes at short intervals, in
order to keep hold of his subject, which is still slipping
from him, and to give him time for recollection;
or, in mere aid of vacancy, as in the scanty
companies of a country stage the same player pops
backwards and forwards, in order to prevent the
appearance of empty spaces, in the procession of
<i>Macbeth</i>, or <i>Henry VIII</i>. But what assistance to
the poet, or ornament to the poem, these can supply,
I am at a loss to conjecture. Nothing assuredly
can differ either in origin or in mode more
widely from the apparent tautologies of intense and
turbulent feeling, in which the passion is greater
and of longer endurance than to be exhausted or
satisfied by a single representation of the image or
incident exciting it. Such repetitions I admit to
be a beauty of the highest kind; as illustrated by
Mr. Wordsworth himself from the song of Deborah.
<i>At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet
he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down
dead.</i></p>

<h4>[<i>Biographia Literaria</i>, chap. xviii, 1817]</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">I conclude</span>, therefore, that the attempt is impracticable;
and that, were it not impracticable,
it would still be useless. For the very power of
making the selection implies the previous possession
of the language selected. Or where can the poet
have lived? And by what rules could he direct
his choice, which would not have enabled him to
select and arrange his words by the light of his
own judgement? We do not adopt the language
of a class by the mere adoption of such words
exclusively, as that class would use, or at least
understand; but likewise by following the order, in
which the words of such men are wont to succeed
each other. Now this order, in the intercourse of
uneducated men, is distinguished from the diction
of their superiors in knowledge and power, by the
greater disjunction and separation in the component
parts of that, whatever it be, which they
wish to communicate. There is a want of that
prospectiveness of mind, that surview, which enables
a man to foresee the whole of what he is to
convey, appertaining to any one point; and by
this means so to subordinate and arrange the
different parts according to their relative importance,
as to convey it at once, and as an organized
whole.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Now I will take the first stanza, on which I have
chanced to open, in the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>. It is one
the most simple and the least peculiar in its language.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In distant countries have I been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet I have not often seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A healthy man, a man full grown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weep in the public roads, alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But such a one, on English ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the broad highway, I met;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the broad highway he came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cheeks with tears were wet:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sturdy he seem&#8217;d, though he was sad;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his arms a lamb he had.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The words here are doubtless such as are current
in all ranks of life; and of course not less so in the
hamlet and cottage than in the shop, manufactory,
college, or palace. But is this the order, in which
the rustic would have placed the words? I am
grievously deceived, if the following less compact
mode of commencing the same tale be not a far
more faithful copy. &#8216;I have been in a many parts,
far and near, and I don&#8217;t know that I ever saw
before a man crying by himself in the public road;
a grown man I mean, that was neither sick nor
hurt,&#8217; &amp;c., &amp;c. But when I turn to the following
stanza in <i>The Thorn</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At all times of the day and night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This wretched woman thither goes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she is known to every star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every wind that blows:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there, beside the thorn, she sits,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the blue day-light&#8217;s in the skies:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the whirlwind&#8217;s on the hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or frosty air is keen and still;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to herself she cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh misery! Oh misery!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh woe is me! Oh misery!<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></div></div>

<p class="noin">and compare this with the language of ordinary
men; or with that which I can conceive at all
likely to proceed, in real life, from such a narrator,
as is supposed in the note to the poem; compare
it either in the succession of the images or of the
sentences; I am reminded of the sublime prayer
and hymn of praise, which <span class="smcap">Milton</span>, in opposition
to an established liturgy, presents as a fair specimen
of common extemporary devotion, and such as
we might expect to hear from every self-inspired
minister of a conventicle! And I reflect with delight,
how little a mere theory, though of his own
workmanship, interferes with the processes of
genuine imagination in a man of true poetic genius,
who possesses, as Mr. Wordsworth, if ever man did,
most assuredly does possess,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Vision and the Faculty Divine.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p class="newsection">One point then alone remains, but that the most
important; its examination having been, indeed,
my chief inducement for the preceding inquisition.
&#8216;<i>There neither is nor can be any essential difference
between the language of prose and metrical composition.</i>&#8217;
Such is Mr. Wordsworth&#8217;s assertion. Now
prose itself, at least in all argumentative and consecutive
works, differs, and ought to differ, from the
language of conversation; even as reading ought
to differ from talking. Unless therefore the difference
denied be that of the mere words, as materials
common to all styles of writing, and not of the
style itself in the universally admitted sense of the
term, it might be naturally presumed that there
must exist a still greater between the ordonnance
of poetic composition and that of prose, than is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
expected to distinguish prose from ordinary conversation.</p>

<p>There are not, indeed, examples wanting in the
history of literature, of apparent paradoxes that
have summoned the public wonder as new and
startling truths, but which, on examination, have
shrunk into tame and harmless truisms; as the
eyes of a cat, seen in the dark, have been mistaken
for flames of fire. But Mr. Wordsworth is among
the last men, to whom a delusion of this kind would
be attributed by any one who had enjoyed the
slightest opportunity of understanding his mind
and character. Where an objection has been anticipated
by such an author as natural, his answer
to it must needs be interpreted in some sense which
either is, or has been, or is capable of being controverted.
My object then must be to discover some
other meaning for the term &#8216;<i>essential difference</i>&#8217;
in this place, exclusive of the indistinction and
community of the words themselves. For whether
there ought to exist a class of words in the English,
in any degree resembling the poetic dialect of the
Greek and Italian, is a question of very subordinate
importance. The number of such words would be
small indeed, in our language; and even in the
Italian and Greek, they consist not so much of
different words, as of slight differences in the forms
of declining and conjugating the same words;
forms, doubtless, which having been, at some
period more or less remote, the common grammatic
flexions of some tribe or province, had been accidentally
appropriated to poetry by the general
admiration of certain master intellects, the first
established lights of inspiration, to whom that
dialect happened to be native.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Essence, in its primary signification, means the
principle of individuation, the inmost principle of
the possibility of any thing, as that particular thing.
It is equivalent to the idea of a thing, whenever
we use the word, idea, with philosophic precision.
Existence, on the other hand, is distinguished from
essence, by the superinduction of reality. Thus we
speak of the essence, and essential properties of
a circle; but we do not therefore assert, that any
thing, which really exists, is mathematically circular.
Thus too, without any tautology we contend
for the existence of the Supreme Being; that
is, for a reality correspondent to the idea. There
is, next, a secondary use of the word essence, in
which it signifies the point or ground of contradistinction
between two modifications of the same
substance or subject. Thus we should be allowed
to say, that the style of architecture of Westminster
Abbey is essentially different from that of St. Paul&#8217;s,
even though both had been built with blocks cut
into the same form, and from the same quarry.
Only in this latter sense of the term must it have
been denied by Mr. Wordsworth (for in this sense
alone is it affirmed by the general opinion) that the
language of poetry (i. e. the formal construction, or
architecture, of the words and phrases) is essentially
different from that of prose. Now the burthen of
the proof lies with the oppugner, not with the supporters
of the common belief. Mr. Wordsworth,
in consequence, assigns as the proof of his position,
&#8216;that not only the language of a large portion of
every good poem, even of the most elevated character,
must necessarily, except with reference to
the metre, in no respect differ from that of good
prose, but likewise that some of the most interesting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
parts of the best poems will be found to be strictly
the language of prose, when prose is well written.
The truth of this assertion might be demonstrated
by innumerable passages from almost all the poetical
writings even of Milton himself.&#8217; He then
quotes Gray&#8217;s sonnet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In vain to me the smiling mornings shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reddening Phoebus lifts his golden fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The birds in vain their amorous descant join,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or cheerful fields resume their green attire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These ears, alas! for other notes repine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A different object do these eyes require;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>My lonely anguish melts no heart but mine;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And in my breast the imperfect joys expire.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet morning smiles the busy race to cheer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And newborn pleasure brings to happier men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fields to all their wonted tribute bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To warm their little loves the birds complain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I fruitless mourn to him that cannot hear,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And weep the more because I weep in vain</i>,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">and adds the following remark:&mdash;&#8216;It will easily be
perceived, that the only part of this Sonnet, which
is of any value, is the lines printed in italics. It is
equally obvious, that, except in the rhyme, and in
the use of the single word &#8220;fruitless&#8221; for &#8220;fruitlessly&#8221;,
which is so far a defect, the language of
these lines does in no respect differ from that of
prose.&#8217;</p>

<p>An idealist defending his system by the fact, that
when asleep we often believe ourselves awake, was
well answered by his plain neighbour, &#8216;Ah, but
when awake do we ever believe ourselves asleep?&#8217;&mdash;Things
identical must be convertible. The preceding
passage seems to rest on a similar sophism.
For the question is not, whether there may not
occur in prose an order of words, which would be
equally proper in a poem; nor whether there are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
not beautiful lines and sentences of frequent occurrence
in good poems, which would be equally becoming
as well as beautiful in good prose; for
neither the one nor the other has ever been either
denied or doubted by any one. The true question
must be, whether there are not modes of expression,
a construction, and an order of sentences, which are
in their fit and natural place in a serious prose composition,
but would be disproportionate and heterogeneous
in metrical poetry; and, vice versa,
whether in the language of a serious poem there
may not be an arrangement both of words and
sentences, and a use and selection of (what are
called) <i>figures of speech</i>, both as to their kind, their
frequency, and their occasions, which on a subject
of equal weight would be vicious and alien in
correct and manly prose. I contend, that in both
cases this unfitness of each for the place of the
other frequently will and ought to exist.</p>

<p>And first from the origin of metre. This I
would trace to the balance in the mind effected by
that spontaneous effort which strives to hold in
check the workings of passion. It might be easily
explained likewise in what manner this salutary
antagonism is assisted by the very state, which it
counteracts; and how this balance of antagonists
became organized into metre (in the usual acceptation
of that term) by a supervening act of the will
and judgement, consciously and for the foreseen
purpose of pleasure. Assuming these principles,
as the data of our argument, we deduce from
them two legitimate conditions, which the critic is
entitled to expect in every metrical work. First,
that, as the elements of metre owe their existence to
a state of increased excitement, so the metre itself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
should be accompanied by the natural language
of excitement. Secondly, that as these elements
are formed into metre artificially, by a voluntary
act, with the design and for the purpose of blending
delight with emotion, so the traces of present
volition should throughout the metrical language
be proportionately discernible. Now these two
conditions must be reconciled and co-present.
There must be not only a partnership, but a union;
an interpenetration of passion and of will, of spontaneous
impulse and of voluntary purpose. Again,
this union can be manifested only in a frequency of
forms and figures of speech (originally the offspring
of passion, but now the adopted children of power),
greater than would be desired or endured, where
the emotion is not voluntarily encouraged and
kept up for the sake of that pleasure, which such
emotion, so tempered and mastered by the will, is
found capable of communicating. It not only dictates,
but of itself tends to produce, a more frequent
employment of picturesque and vivifying language,
than would be natural in any other case, in which
there did not exist, as there does in the present, a
previous and well understood, though tacit, <i>compact</i>
between the poet and his reader, that the
latter is entitled to expect, and the former bound
to supply, this species and degree of pleasurable
excitement. We may in some measure apply to
this union the answer of <span class="smcap">Polixenes</span>, in the <i>Winter&#8217;s
Tale</i>, to <span class="smcap">Perdita&#8217;s</span> neglect of the streaked gilly-flowers,
because she had heard it said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There is an art which, in their piedness, shares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With great creating nature.<br /></span>
<span class="i9"><i>Pol.</i> Say there be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet nature is made better by no mean,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But nature makes that mean; so, ev&#8217;n that art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, you say, adds to nature, is an art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A gentler scion to the wildest stock;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make conceive a bark of ruder kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By bud of nobler race. This is an art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which does mend nature&mdash;change it rather; but<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The art itself is nature.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Secondly, I argue from the <small>EFFECTS</small> of metre.
As far as metre acts in and for itself, it tends to
increase the vivacity and susceptibility both of the
general feelings and of the attention. This effect it
produces by the continued excitement of surprise,
and by the quick reciprocations of curiosity still
gratified and still re-excited, which are too slight
indeed to be at any one moment objects of distinct
consciousness, yet become considerable in their
aggregate influence. As a medicated atmosphere,
or as wine during animated conversation, they
act powerfully, though themselves unnoticed.
Where, therefore, correspondent food and appropriate
matter are not provided for the attention
and feelings thus roused, there must needs be a
disappointment felt; like that of leaping in the
dark from the last step of a staircase, when we had
prepared our muscles for a leap of three or four.</p>

<p>The discussion on the powers of metre in the
preface is highly ingenious and touches at all points
on truth. But I cannot find any statement of its
powers considered abstractly and separately. On
the contrary Mr. Wordsworth seems always to estimate
metre by the powers which it exerts during
(and, as I think, in consequence of) its combination
with other elements of poetry. Thus the previous
difficulty is left unanswered, what the elements are
with which it must be combined, in order to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
produce its own effects to any pleasureable purpose.
Double and tri-syllable rhymes, indeed, form a
lower species of wit, and, attended to exclusively
for their own sake, may become a source of momentary
amusement; as in poor Smart&#8217;s distich to the
Welsh Squire who had promised him a hare:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tell me, thou son of great Cadwallader!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast sent the hare? or hast thou swallowed her?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But for any poetic purposes, metre resembles (if
the aptness of the simile may excuse its meanness)
yeast, worthless or disagreeable by itself, but giving
vivacity and spirit to the liquor with which it is
proportionately combined.</p>

<p>The reference to <i>The Children in the Wood</i> by no
means satisfies my judgement. We all willingly
throw ourselves back for awhile into the feelings
of our childhood. This ballad, therefore, we read
under such recollections of our own childish feelings,
as would equally endear to us poems, which
Mr. Wordsworth himself would regard as faulty in
the opposite extreme of gaudy and technical ornament.
Before the invention of printing, and in
a still greater degree, before the introduction of
writing, metre, especially alliterative metre (whether
alliterative at the beginning of the words, as in
<i>Piers Plowman</i>, or at the end, as in rhymes),
possessed an independent value as assisting the
recollection, and consequently the preservation, of
<i>any</i> series of truths or incidents. But I am not
convinced by the collation of facts, that <i>The
Children in the Wood</i> owes either its preservation,
or its popularity, to its metrical form. Mr. Marshal&#8217;s
repository affords a number of tales in prose
inferior in pathos and general merit, some of as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
old a date, and many as widely popular. <i>Tom
Hickathrift</i>, <i>Jack the Giant-killer</i>, <i>Goody Two-shoes</i>,
and <i>Little Red Riding-hood</i> are formidable rivals.
And that they have continued in prose, cannot be
fairly explained by the assumption, that the comparative
meanness of their thoughts and images
precluded even the humblest forms of metre. The
scene of <i>Goody Two-shoes</i> in the church is perfectly
susceptible of metrical narration; and, among the
&#920;&#945;&#8017;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#952;&#945;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8001;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#945; even of the present age, I do
not recollect a more astonishing image than that of
the &#8216;<i>whole rookery, that flew out of the giant&#8217;s beard</i>&#8217;,
scared by the tremendous voice, with which this
monster answered the challenge of the heroic <i>Tom
Hickathrift</i>!</p>

<p>If from these we turn to compositions universally,
and independently of all early associations,
beloved and admired, would <i>The Maria</i>,
<i>The Monk</i>, or <i>The Poor Man&#8217;s Ass</i> of Sterne, be
read with more delight, or have a better chance of
immortality, had they without any change in the
diction been composed in rhyme, than in their
present state? If I am not grossly mistaken,
the general reply would be in the negative. Nay,
I will confess, that, in Mr. Wordsworth&#8217;s own
volumes, the <i>Anecdote for Fathers</i>, <i>Simon Lee</i>,
<i>Alice Fell</i>, <i>The Beggars</i>, and <i>The Sailor&#8217;s Mother</i>,
notwithstanding the beauties which are to be
found in each of them where the poet interposes
the music of his own thoughts, would have been
more delightful to me in prose, told and managed,
as by Mr. Wordsworth they would have been, in
a moral essay, or pedestrian tour.</p>

<p>Metre in itself is simply a stimulant of the attention,
and therefore excites the question: Why is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the attention to be thus stimulated? Now the
question cannot be answered by the pleasure of the
metre itself: for this we have shown to be conditional,
and dependent on the appropriateness of the
thoughts and expressions, to which the metrical
form is superadded. Neither can I conceive any
other answer that can be rationally given, short of
this: I write in metre, because I am about to use
a language different from that of prose. Besides,
where the language is not such, how interesting
soever the reflections are, that are capable of being
drawn by a philosophic mind from the thoughts
or incidents of the poem, the metre itself must
often become feeble. Take the last three stanzas
of <i>The Sailor&#8217;s Mother</i>, for instance. If I could
for a moment abstract from the effect produced on
the author&#8217;s feelings, as a man, by the incident at
the time of its real occurrence, I would dare appeal
to his own judgement, whether in the metre itself he
found a sufficient reason for their being written
metrically?</p>

<p>If disproportioning the emphasis we read these
stanzas so as to make the rhymes perceptible, even
tri-syllable rhymes could scarcely produce an equal
sense of oddity and strangeness, as we feel here in
finding rhymes at all in sentences so exclusively
colloquial. I would further ask whether, but for
that visionary state, into which the figure of the
woman and the susceptibility of his own genius
had placed the poet&#8217;s imagination (a state, which
spreads its influence and colouring over all, that
co-exists with the exciting cause, and in which</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The simplest, and the most familiar things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gain a strange power of spreading awe around them),<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">I would ask the poet whether he would not have
felt an abrupt downfall in these verses from the
preceding stanza?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The ancient spirit is not dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old times, thought I, are breathing there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud was I that my country bred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such strength, a dignity so fair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She begged an alms, like one in poor estate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I looked at her again, nor did my pride abate.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It must not be omitted, and is besides worthy
of notice, that those stanzas furnish the only fair
instance that I have been able to discover in all
Mr. Wordsworth&#8217;s writings, of an actual adoption,
or true imitation, of the real and very language of
low and rustic life, freed from provincialisms.</p>

<p>Thirdly, I deduce the position from all the
causes elsewhere assigned, which render metre
the proper form of poetry, and poetry imperfect
and defective without metre. Metre, therefore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
having been connected with poetry most often and
by a peculiar fitness, whatever else is combined
with metre must, though it be not itself essentially
poetic, have nevertheless some property in common
with poetry, as an intermedium of affinity, a sort
(if I may dare borrow a well-known phrase from
technical chemistry) of <i>mordaunt</i> between it and
the superadded metre. Now poetry, Mr. Wordsworth
truly affirms, does always imply <small>PASSION</small>:
which word must be here understood in its most
general sense, as an excited state of the feelings
and faculties. And as every passion has its proper
pulse, so will it likewise have its characteristic
modes of expression. But where there exists that
degree of genius and talent which entitles a writer
to aim at the honours of a poet, the very act of
poetic composition itself is, and is allowed to imply
and to produce, an unusual state of excitement,
which of course justifies and demands a correspondent
difference of language, as truly, though not
perhaps in as marked a degree, as the excitement
of love, fear, rage, or jealousy. The vividness
of the descriptions or declamations in <span class="smcap">Donne</span>
or <span class="smcap">Dryden</span> is as much and as often derived from
the force and fervour of the describer, as from the
reflections, forms or incidents, which constitute
their subject and materials. The wheels take fire
from the mere rapidity of their motion. To what
extent, and under what modifications, this may be
admitted to act, I shall attempt to define in an
after remark on Mr. Wordsworth&#8217;s reply to this
objection, or rather on his objection to this reply,
as already anticipated in his preface.</p>

<p>Fourthly, and as intimately connected with this,
if not the same argument in a more general form,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
I adduce the high spiritual instinct of the human
being impelling us to seek unity by harmonious
adjustment, and thus establishing the principle,
that all the parts of an organized whole must be
assimilated to the more important and essential
parts. This and the preceding arguments may be
strengthened by the reflection, that the composition
of a poem is among the imitative arts; and
that imitation, as opposed to copying, consists
either in the interfusion of the same throughout the
radically different, or of the different throughout
a base radically the same.</p>

<p>Lastly, I appeal to the practice of the best poets,
of all countries and in all ages, as authorizing the
opinion, (deduced from all the foregoing,) that in
every import of the word essential, which would
not here involve a mere truism, there may be, is,
and ought to be an essential difference between the
language of prose and of metrical composition.</p>

<p>In Mr. Wordsworth&#8217;s criticism of Gray&#8217;s Sonnet,
the readers&#8217; sympathy with his praise or blame of
the different parts is taken for granted rather perhaps
too easily. He has not, at least, attempted
to win or compel it by argumentative analysis. In
my conception at least, the lines rejected as of no
value do, with the exception of the two first, differ
as much and as little from the language of common
life, as those which he has printed in italics as
possessing genuine excellence. Of the five lines thus
honourably distinguished, two of them differ from
prose, even more widely than the lines which either
precede or follow, in the position of the words.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>A different object do these eyes require;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My lonely anguish melts no heart but mine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And in my breast the imperfect joys expire.</i><br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></div></div>

<p>But were it otherwise, what would this prove,
but a truth, of which no man ever doubted?
Videlicet, that there are sentences, which would be
equally in their place both in verse and prose.
Assuredly it does not prove the point, which alone
requires proof; namely, that there are not passages,
which would suit the one and not suit the
other. The first line of this sonnet is distinguished
from the ordinary language of men by the epithet
to &#8216;<i>morning</i>&#8217;. (For we will set aside, at present, the
consideration, that the particular word &#8216;<i>smiling</i>&#8217; is
hackneyed and (as it involves a sort of personification)
not quite congruous with the common and
material attribute of <i>shining</i>.) And, doubtless, this
adjunction of epithets for the purpose of additional
description, where no particular attention is demanded
for the quality of the thing, would be
noticed as giving a poetic cast to a man&#8217;s conversation.
Should the sportsman exclaim, &#8216;<i>Come boys!
the rosy morning calls you up</i>&#8217;, he will be supposed
to have some song in his head. But no one suspects
this, when he says, &#8216;A wet morning shall not
confine us to our beds.&#8217; This then is either a defect
in poetry, or it is not. Whoever should decide in
the affirmative, I would request him to re-peruse
any one poem, of any confessedly great poet from
Homer to Milton, or from Aeschylus to Shakespeare;
and to strike out (in thought I mean) every
instance of this kind. If the number of these
fancied erasures did not startle him, or if he
continued to deem the work improved by their
total omission, he must advance reasons of no
ordinary strength and evidence, reasons grounded
in the essence of human nature. Otherwise,
I should not hesitate to consider him as a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
not so much proof against all authority, as dead
to it.</p>

<p>The second line,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And reddening Phoebus lifts his golden fire;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">has indeed almost as many faults as words. But
then it is a bad line, not because the language is
distinct from that of prose, but because it conveys
incongruous images, because it confounds the
cause and the effect, the real thing with the personified
representative of the thing; in short,
because it differs from the language of good sense!
That the &#8216;Phoebus&#8217; is hackneyed, and a school-boy
image, is an accidental fault, dependent on the age
in which the author wrote, and not deduced from
the nature of the thing. That it is part of an
exploded mythology, is an objection more deeply
grounded. Yet when the torch of ancient learning
was rekindled, so cheering were its beams, that
our eldest poets, cut off by Christianity from all
accredited machinery, and deprived of all acknowledged
guardians and symbols of the great objects
of nature, were naturally induced to adopt, as
a poetic language, those fabulous personages, those
forms of the supernatural in nature, which had
given them such dear delight in the poems of their
great masters. Nay, even at this day what scholar
of genial taste will not so far sympathize with
them, as to read with pleasure in Petrarch,
Chaucer, or Spenser, what he would perhaps
condemn as puerile in a modern poet?</p>

<p>I remember no poet, whose writings would
safelier stand the test of Mr. Wordsworth&#8217;s theory,
than Spenser. Yet will Mr. Wordsworth say,
that the style of the following stanza is either<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
undistinguished from prose, and the language of
ordinary life? Or that it is vicious, and that the
stanzas are blots in the <i>Faerie Queene</i>?</p>

<p>On the contrary to how many passages, both in
hymn books and in blank verse poems, could I
(were it not invidious) direct the reader&#8217;s attention,

only because, it is the style of prose? He will not

<p>To such specimens it would indeed be a fair and
full reply, that these lines are not bad, because
they are unpoetic; but because they are empty of
all sense and feeling; and that it were an idle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
attempt to prove that an ape is not a Newton,
when it is evident that he is not a man. But the
sense shall be good and weighty, the language
correct and dignified, the subject interesting and
treated with feeling; and yet the style shall, notwithstanding
all these merits, be justly blamable
as prosaic, and solely because the words and the
order of the words would find their appropriate
place in prose, but are not suitable to metrical
composition. The <i>Civil Wars</i> of Daniel is an instructive,

<p>Will it be contended on the one side, that these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
lines are mean and senseless? Or on the other,
that they are not prosaic, and for that reason unpoetic?
This poet&#8217;s well-merited epithet is that
of the &#8216;<i>well-languaged Daniel</i>&#8217;; but likewise, and
by the consent of his contemporaries no less than
of all succeeding critics, the &#8216;prosaic Daniel.&#8217; Yet
those, who thus designate this wise and amiable
writer, from the frequent incorrespondency of his
diction to his metre in the majority of his compositions,
not only deem them valuable and interesting
on other accounts, but willingly admit that there
are to be found throughout his poems, and especially
in his <i>Epistles</i> and in his <i>Hymen&#8217;s Triumph</i>,
many and exquisite specimens of that style which,
as the neutral ground of prose and verse, is common
to both. A fine and almost faultless extract,
eminent, as for other beauties, so for its perfection
in these species of diction, may be seen in Lamb&#8217;s
<i>Dramatic Specimens</i>, &amp;c., a work of various interest
from the nature of the selections themselves, (all
from the plays of Shakespeare&#8217;s contemporaries),
and deriving a high additional value from the notes,
which are full of just and original criticism, expressed
with all the freshness of originality.</p>

<p>Among the possible effects of practical adherence
to a theory that aims to identify the style of prose
and verse,&mdash;(if it does not indeed claim for the
latter a yet nearer resemblance to the average
style of men in the viva voce intercourse of real
life)&mdash;we might anticipate the following as not the
least likely to occur. It will happen, as I have
indeed before observed, that the metre itself, the
sole acknowledged difference, will occasionally
become metre to the eye only. The existence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
prosaisms, and that they detract from the merit of
a poem, must at length be conceded, when a number
of successive lines can be rendered, even to the
most delicate ear, unrecognizable as verse, or as
having even been intended for verse, by simply
transcribing them as prose; when if the poem be
in blank verse, this can be effected without any
alteration, or at most by merely restoring one or
two words to their proper places, from which they
have been transplanted<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> for no assignable cause or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>reason but that of the author&#8217;s convenience; but
if it be in rhyme, by the mere exchange of the final
word of each line for some other of the same
meaning, equally appropriate, dignified and
euphonic.</p>

<p>The answer or objection in the preface to the
anticipated remark &#8216;that metre paves the way to
other distinctions&#8217;, is contained in the following
words. &#8216;The distinction of rhyme and metre is
voluntary and uniform, and not, like that produced
by (what is called) poetic diction, arbitrary,
and subject to infinite caprices, upon which no
calculation whatever can be made. In the one
case the reader is utterly at the mercy of the poet
respecting what imagery or diction he may choose
to connect with the passion.&#8217; But is this a poet, of
whom a poet is speaking? No surely! rather of
a fool or madman: or at best of a vain or ignorant
phantast! And might not brains so wild and so deficient
make just the same havoc with rhymes and
metres, as they are supposed to effect with modes
and figures of speech? How is the reader at the
mercy of such men? If he continue to read their
nonsense, is it not his own fault? The ultimate
end of criticism is much more to establish the
principles of writing, than to furnish rules how to
pass judgement on what has been written by
others; if indeed it were possible that the two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
could be separated. But if it be asked, by what
principles the poet is to regulate his own style, if
he do not adhere closely to the sort and order of
words which he hears in the market, wake, high-road,
or plough-field? I reply; by principles, the
ignorance or neglect of which would convict him of
being no poet, but a silly or presumptuous usurper
of the name! By the principles of grammar,
logic, psychology! In one word, by such a knowledge
of the facts, material and spiritual, that most
appertain to his art, as, if it have been governed and
applied by good sense, and rendered instinctive by
habit, becomes the representative and reward of
our past conscious reasonings, insights, and conclusions,
and acquires the name of <span class="smcap">Taste</span>. By
what rule that does not leave the reader at the
poet&#8217;s mercy, and the poet at his own, is the latter
to distinguish between the language suitable to
suppressed, and the language, which is characteristic
of indulged, anger? Or between that of rage
and that of jealousy? Is it obtained by wandering
about in search of angry or jealous people in uncultivated
society, in order to copy their words? Or
not far rather by the power of imagination proceeding
upon the all in each of human nature?
By meditation, rather than by observation? And by
the latter in consequence only of the former? As
eyes, for which the former has pre-determined
their field of vision, and to which, as to its organ, it
communicates a microscopic power? There is not,
I firmly believe, a man now living, who has, from
his own inward experience, a clearer intuition than
Mr. Wordsworth himself, that the last mentioned
are the true sources of genial discrimination.
Through the same process and by the same creative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
agency will the poet distinguish the degree and kind
of the excitement produced by the very act of
poetic composition. As intuitively will he know,
what differences of style it at once inspires and
justifies; what intermixture of conscious volition
is natural to that state; and in what instances such
figures and colours of speech degenerate into mere
creatures of an arbitrary purpose, cold technical
artifices of ornament or connexion. For, even as
truth is its own light and evidence, discovering at
once itself and falsehood, so is it the prerogative
of poetic genius to distinguish by parental instinct
its proper offspring from the changelings, which
the gnomes of vanity or the fairies of fashion may
have laid in its cradle or called by its names.
Could a rule be given from without, poetry would
cease to be poetry, and sink into a mechanical art.
It would be &#956;&#8001;&#961;&#966;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#962;, not &#960;&#959;&#7985;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;. The rules of
the <span class="smcap">Imagination</span> are themselves the very powers
of growth and production. The words to which
they are reducible, present only the outlines and
external appearance of the fruit. A deceptive
counterfeit of the superficial form and colours may
be elaborated; but the marble peach feels cold and
heavy, and children only put it to their mouths.
We find no difficulty in admitting as excellent, and
the legitimate language of poetic fervour self-impassioned,
Donne&#8217;s apostrophe to the Sun in the
second stanza of his <i>Progress of the Soul</i>.</p>

<p>As little difficulty do we find in excluding from
the honours of unaffected warmth and elevation
the madness prepense of pseudo-poesy, or the
startling hysteric of weakness over-exerting itself,
which bursts on the unprepared reader in sundry
odes and apostrophes to abstract terms. Such are
the Odes to Jealousy, to Hope, to Oblivion, and
the like, in Dodsley&#8217;s collection and the magazines
of that day, which seldom fail to remind me of an
Oxford copy of verses on the two Suttons, commencing
with</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Inoculation</span>, heavenly maid! descend!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is not to be denied that men of undoubted
talents, and even poets of true, though not of first-rate,
genius, have from a mistaken theory deluded
both themselves and others in the opposite extreme.
I once read to a company of sensible and
well-educated women the introductory period of
Cowley&#8217;s preface to his <i>Pindaric Odes, written in
imitation of the style and manner of the odes of
Pindar</i>. &#8216;If (says Cowley) a man should undertake
to translate Pindar, word for word, it would
be thought that one madman had translated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
another: as may appear, when he, that understands
not the original, reads the verbal traduction of
him into Latin prose, than which nothing seems
more raving.&#8217; I then proceeded with his own free
version of the second Olympic, composed for the
charitable purpose of rationalizing the Theban
Eagle.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Queen of all harmonious things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dancing words and speaking strings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What God, what hero, wilt thou sing?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What happy man to equal glories bring?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begin, begin thy noble choice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let the hills around reflect the image of thy voice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pisa does to Jove belong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jove and Pisa claim thy song.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fair first-fruits of war, th&#8217; Olympic games,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alcides offer&#8217;d up to Jove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alcides too thy strings may move!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, oh! what man to join with these can worthy prove?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Join Theron boldly to their sacred names;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Theron the next honour claims;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Theron to no man gives place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is first in Pisa&#8217;s and in Virtue&#8217;s race;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Theron there, and he alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ev&#8217;n his own swift forefathers has outgone.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One of the company exclaimed, with the full
assent of the rest, that if the original were madder
than this, it must be incurably mad. I then translated
the ode from the Greek, and as nearly as
possible, word for word; and the impression was,
that in the general movement of the periods, in the
form of the connexions and transitions, and in the
sober majesty of lofty sense, it appeared to them
to approach more nearly, than any other poetry
they had heard, to the style of our Bible in the
prophetic books. The first strophe will suffice as
a specimen:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ye harp-controling hymns! (or) ye hymns the sovereigns of harps!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What God? what Hero?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What Man shall we celebrate?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Truly Pisa indeed is of Jove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the Olympiad (or the Olympic games) did Hercules establish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first-fruits of the spoils of war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Theron for the four-horsed car,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bore victory to him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It behoves us now to voice aloud:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Just, the Hospitable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Bulwark of Agrigentum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of renowned fathers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Flower, even him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who preserves his native city erect and safe.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But are such rhetorical caprices condemnable
only for their deviation from the language of real
life? and are they by no other means to be
precluded, but by the rejection of all distinctions
between prose and verse, save that of metre?
Surely good sense, and a moderate insight into the
constitution of the human mind, would be amply
sufficient to prove, that such language and such
combinations are the native produce neither of the
fancy nor of the imagination; that their operation
consists in the excitement of surprise by the juxtaposition
and apparent reconciliation of widely
different or incompatible things. As when, for
instance, the hills are made to reflect the image of
a voice. Surely, no unusual taste is requisite to
see clearly, that this compulsory juxtaposition is
not produced by the presentation of impressive or
delightful forms to the inward vision, nor by any
sympathy with the modifying powers with which
the genius of the poet had united and inspirited all
the objects of his thought; that it is therefore a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
species of wit, a pure work of the will, and implies
a leisure and self-possession both of thought and
of feeling, incompatible with the steady fervour of
a mind possessed and filled with the grandeur of its
subject. To sum up the whole in one sentence.
When a poem, or a part of a poem, shall be adduced,
which is evidently vicious in the figures and
contexture of its style, yet for the condemnation
of which no reason can be assigned, except that it
differs from the style in which men actually converse,
then, and not till then, can I hold this
theory to be either plausible, or practicable, or
capable of furnishing either rule, guidance, or precaution,
that might not, more easily and more
safely, as well as more naturally, have been deduced
in the author&#8217;s own mind from considerations of
grammar, logic, and the truth and nature of
things, confirmed by the authority of works, whose
fame is not of <small>ONE</small> country nor of <small>ONE</small> age.</p>

<p>
In those parts of Mr. Wordsworth&#8217;s works which I have
thoroughly studied, I find fewer instances in which this
would be practicable than I have met in many poems,
where an approximation of prose has been sedulously
and on system guarded against. Indeed excepting the
stanzas already quoted from <i>The Sailor&#8217;s Mother</i>, I can
recollect but one instance: viz. a short passage of four or
five lines in <i>The Brothers</i>, that model of English pastoral,
which I never yet read with unclouded eye.&mdash;&#8216;James,
pointing to its summit, over which they had all
purposed to return together, informed them that he would
wait for them there. They parted, and his comrades passed
that way some two hours after, but they did not find him at
the appointed place, <i>a circumstance of which they took no
heed</i>: but one of them, going by chance into the house,
which at this time was James&#8217;s house, learnt <i>there</i>, that
nobody had seen him all that day.&#8217; The only change
which has been made is in the position of the little word
<i>there</i> in two instances, the position in the original being
clearly such as is not adopted in ordinary conversation.
The other words printed in <i>italics</i> were so marked because,
though good and genuine English, they are not the phraseology
of common conversation either in the word put in
apposition, or in the connexion by the genitive pronoun.
Men in general would have said, &#8216;but that was a circumstance
they paid no attention to, or took no notice of;&#8217;
and the language is, on the theory of the preface, justified
only by the narrator&#8217;s being the <i>Vicar</i>. Yet if any ear
<i>could</i> suspect, that these sentences were ever printed as
metre, on those very words alone could the suspicion have
been grounded.</p></div>

<h3>THE CANTERBURY PILGRIMS (1809)</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Sir Geffrey Chaucer and the Nine-and-twenty
Pilgrims on their journey to Canterbury</span><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></h4>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> time chosen is early morning, before sunrise,
when the jolly company are just quitting the
Tabarde Inn. The Knight and Squire with the
Squire&#8217;s Yeoman lead the Procession; next follow
the youthful Abbess, her Nun, and three Priests;
her greyhounds attend her:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of small hounds had she that she fed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With roast flesh, milk, and wastel bread.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Next follow the Friar and Monk; then the Tapiser,
the Pardoner, and the Sompnour and Manciple.
After these &#8216;Our Host&#8217;, who occupies the centre of
the cavalcade, directs them to the Knight as the
person who would be likely to commence their
task of each telling a tale in their order. After the
Host follow the Shipman, the Haberdasher, the
Dyer, the Franklin, the Physician, the Ploughman,
the Lawyer, the Poor Parson, the Merchant, the
Wife of Bath, the Miller, the Cook, the Oxford
Scholar, Chaucer himself; and the Reeve comes
as Chaucer has described:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And ever he rode hinderest of the rout.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">These last are issuing from the gateway of the Inn
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>the Cook and the Wife of Bath are both taking
their morning&#8217;s draught of comfort. Spectators
stand at the gateway of the Inn, and are composed
of an old Man, a Woman, and Children.</p>

<p>The Landscape is an eastward view of the
country, from the Tabarde Inn in Southwark, as
it may be supposed to have appeared in Chaucer&#8217;s
time, interspersed with cottages and villages. The
first beams of the Sun are seen above the horizon;
some buildings and spires indicate the situation
of the Great City. The Inn is a Gothic building,
which Thynne in his Glossary says was the lodging
of the Abbot of Hyde, by Winchester. On the Inn
is inscribed its title, and a proper advantage is
taken of this circumstance to describe the subject of
the Picture. The words written over the gateway
of the Inn are as follow: &#8216;The Tabarde Inn, by
Henry Baillie, the lodgynge-house for Pilgrims who
journey to Saint Thomas&#8217;s Shrine at Canterbury.&#8217;</p>

<p>The characters of Chaucer&#8217;s Pilgrims are the
characters which compose all ages and nations.
As one age falls, another rises, different to mortal
sight, but to immortals only the same; for we see
the same characters repeated again and again, in
animals, vegetables, minerals, and in men. Nothing
new occurs in identical existence; Accident
ever varies, Substance can never suffer change nor
decay.</p>

<p>Of Chaucer&#8217;s characters, as described in his
<i>Canterbury Tales</i>, some of the names or titles are
altered by time, but the characters themselves for
ever remain unaltered; and consequently they
are the physiognomies or lineaments of universal
human life, beyond which Nature never steps.
Names alter, things never alter. I have known<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
multitudes of those who would have been monks
in the age of monkery, who in this deistical age
are deists. As Newton numbered the stars, and
as Linnaeus numbered the plants, so Chaucer
numbered the classes of men.</p>

<p>The Painter has consequently varied the heads
and forms of his personages into all Nature&#8217;s
varieties; the horses he has also varied to accord
to their riders; the costume is correct according
to authentic monuments.</p>

<p>The Knight and Squire with the Squire&#8217;s Yeoman
lead the Procession, as Chaucer has also
placed them first in his Prologue. The Knight is
a true Hero, a good, great and wise man; his
whole-length portrait on horseback, as written by
Chaucer, cannot be surpassed. He has spent his
life in the field, has ever been a conqueror, and is
that species of character which in every age stands
as the guardian of man against the oppressor. His
son is like him, with the germ of perhaps greater
perfection still, as he blends literature and the arts
with his warlike studies. Their dress and their
horses are of the first rate, without ostentation,
and with all the true grandeur that unaffected
simplicity when in high rank always displays.
The Squire&#8217;s Yeoman is also a great character,
a man perfectly knowing in his profession:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And in his hand he bare a mighty bow.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Chaucer describes here a mighty man, one who in
war is the worthy attendant on noble heroes.</p>

<p>The Prioress follows these with her female
Chaplain:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Another Nonne also with her had she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That was her Chaplaine, and Priests three.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></div></div>

<p class="noin">This Lady is described also as of the first rank,
rich and honoured. She has certain peculiarities
and little delicate affectations, not unbecoming in
her, being accompanied with what is truly grand
and really polite; her person and face Chaucer
has described with minuteness; it is very elegant,
and was the beauty of our ancestors till after
Elizabeth&#8217;s time, when voluptuousness and folly
began to be accounted beautiful.</p>

<p>Her companion and her three Priests were no
doubt all perfectly delineated in those parts of
Chaucer&#8217;s work which are now lost; we ought to
suppose them suitable attendants on rank and
fashion.</p>

<p>The Monk follows these with the Friar. The
Painter has also grouped with these the Pardoner
and the Sompnour and the Manciple, and has here
also introduced one of the rich citizens of London&mdash;characters
likely to ride in company, all being
above the common rank in life, or attendants on
those who were so.</p>

<p>For the Monk is described by Chaucer, as a man
of the first rank in society, noble, rich, and expensively
attended; he is a leader of the age, with
certain humorous accompaniments in his character,
that do not degrade, but render him an object of
dignified mirth, but also with other accompaniments
not so respectable.</p>

<p>The Friar is a character of a mixed kind:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A friar there was, a wanton and a merry;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">but in his office he is said to be a &#8216;full solemn
man&#8217;; eloquent, amorous, witty and satirical;
young, handsome and rich; he is a complete rogue,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
with constitutional gaiety enough to make him a
master of all the pleasures of the world:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His neck was white as the flour de lis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereto strong he was as a champioun.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is necessary here to speak of Chaucer&#8217;s own
character, that I may set certain mistaken critics
right in their conception of the humour and fun
that occur on the journey. Chaucer is himself the
great poetical observer of men, who in every age
is born to record and eternize its acts. This he
does as a master, as a father and superior, who
looks down on their little follies from the Emperor
to the Miller, sometimes with severity, oftener
with joke and sport.</p>

<p>Accordingly Chaucer has made his Monk a great
tragedian, one who studied poetical art. So much
so that the generous Knight is, in the compassionate
dictates of his soul, compelled to cry out:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Ho,&#8217; quoth the Knyght, &#8216;good Sir, no more of this;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ye have said is right ynough, I wis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mokell more; for little heaviness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is right enough for much folk, as I guesse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I say, for me, it is a great disease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereas men have been in wealth and ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To heare of their sudden fall, alas!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the contrary is joy and solas.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Monk&#8217;s definition of tragedy in the proem
to his tale is worth repeating:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tragedie is to tell a certain story,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As old books us maken memory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hem that stood in great prosperity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be fallen out of high degree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into miserie, and ended wretchedly.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Though a man of luxury, pride and pleasure, he
is a master of art and learning, though affecting to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
despise it. Those who can think that the proud
huntsman and noble housekeeper, Chaucer&#8217;s Monk,
is intended for a buffoon or burlesque character,
know little of Chaucer.</p>

<p>For the Host who follows this group, and holds
the centre of the cavalcade, is a first-rate character,
and his jokes are no trifles; they are always,
though uttered with audacity, and equally free with
the Lord and the Peasant&mdash;they are always substantially
and weightily expressive of knowledge
and experience; Henry Baillie, the keeper of the
greatest Inn of the greatest City, for such was the
Tabarde Inn in Southwark near London, our Host,
was also a leader of the age.</p>

<p>By way of illustration I instance Shakespeare&#8217;s
Witches in <i>Macbeth</i>. Those who dress them for
the stage, consider them as wretched old women,
and not, as Shakespeare intended, the Goddesses
of Destiny; this shows how Chaucer has been
misunderstood in his sublime work. Shakespeare&#8217;s
Fairies also are the rulers of the vegetable world,
and so are Chaucer&#8217;s; let them be so considered,
and then the poet will be understood, and not
else.</p>

<p>But I have omitted to speak of a very prominent
character, the Pardoner, the Age&#8217;s Knave, who
always commands and domineers over the high and
low vulgar. This man is sent in every age for a rod
and scourge, and for a blight, for a trial of men, to
divide the classes of men; he is in the most holy
sanctuary, and he is suffered by Providence for
wise ends, and has also his great use, and his grand
leading destiny.</p>

<p>His companion the Sompnour is also a Devil of
the first magnitude, grand, terrific, rich, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
honoured in the rank of which he holds the destiny.
The uses to society are perhaps equal of the Devil
and of the Angel; their sublimity who can
dispute?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In daunger had he at his own gise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young girls of his diocese,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he knew well their counsel, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The principal figure in the next group is the
Good Parson; an Apostle, a real Messenger of
Heaven, sent in every age for its light and its
warmth. This man is beloved and venerated by
all, and neglected by all: he serves all, and is
served by none. He is, according to Christ&#8217;s
definition, the greatest of his age: yet he is a Poor
Parson of a town. Read Chaucer&#8217;s description of
the Good Parson, and bow the head and the knee
to Him, Who in every age sends us such a burning
and a shining light. Search, O ye rich and powerful,
for these men and obey their counsel; then
shall the golden age return. But alas! you will
not easily distinguish him from the Friar or the
Pardoner; they also are &#8216;full solemn men&#8217;, and
their counsel you will continue to follow.</p>

<p>I have placed by his side the Sergeant-at-Lawe,
who appears delighted to ride in his company, and
between him and his brother the Ploughman;
as I wish men of law would always ride with
them, and take their counsel, especially in all difficult
points. Chaucer&#8217;s Lawyer is a character of
great venerableness, a Judge and a real master
of the jurisprudence of his age.</p>

<p>The Doctor of Physic is in this group; and
the Franklin, the voluptuous country gentleman,
contrasted with the Physician, and, on his other
hand, with two Citizens of London. Chaucer&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
characters live age after age. Every age is a Canterbury
Pilgrimage; we all pass on, each sustaining
one of these characters; nor can a child be born
who is not one or other of these characters of
Chaucer. The Doctor of Physic is described as
the first of his profession, perfect, learned, completely
Master and Doctor in his art. Thus the
reader will observe that Chaucer makes every one
of his characters perfect in his kind; every one is
an Antique Statue, the image of a class and not of
an imperfect individual.</p>

<p>This group also would furnish substantial matter,
on which volumes might be written. The Franklin
is one who keeps open table, who is the genius of
eating and drinking, the Bacchus; as the Doctor
of Physic is the Aesculapius, the Host is the Silenus,
the Squire is the Apollo, the Miller is the Hercules,
&amp;c. Chaucer&#8217;s characters are a description of
the eternal Principles that exist in all ages. The
Franklin is voluptuousness itself, most nobly
portrayed:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It snewed in his house of meat and drink.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Ploughman is simplicity itself, with wisdom
and strength for its stamina. Chaucer has
divided the ancient character of Hercules between
his Miller and his Ploughman. Benevolence is the
Ploughman&#8217;s great characteristic; he is thin with
excessive labour, and not with old age as some have
supposed:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He would thresh, and thereto dike and delve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Christe&#8217;s sake, for every poore wight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Withouten hire, if it lay in his might.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Visions of these eternal principles or characters
of human life appear to poets in all ages; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Grecian gods were the ancient Cherubim of
Phoenicia; but the Greeks, and since them the
Moderns, have neglected to subdue the gods of
Priam. These gods are visions of the eternal
attributes, or divine names, which, when erected
into gods, become destructive to humanity. They
ought to be the servants, and not the masters of
man or of society. They ought to be made to
sacrifice to man, and not man compelled to sacrifice
to them; for, when separated from man or
humanity, who is Jesus the Saviour, the Vine of
Eternity? They are thieves and rebels, they are
destroyers.</p>

<p>The Ploughman of Chaucer is Hercules in his
supreme Eternal State, divested of his Spectrous
Shadow, which is the Miller, a terrible fellow, such
as exists in all times and places for the trial of
men, to astonish every neighbourhood with brutal
strength and courage, to get rich and powerful, to
curb the pride of Man.</p>

<p>The Reeve and the Manciple are two characters
of the most consummate worldly wisdom. The
Shipman, or Sailor, is a similar genius of Ulyssean
art, but with the highest courage superadded.</p>

<p>The Citizens and their Cook are each leaders
of a class. Chaucer has been somehow made to
number four citizens, which would make his whole
company, himself included, thirty-one. But he says
there was but nine-and-twenty in his company:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Full nine and twenty in a company.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Webbe, or Weaver, and the Tapiser, or
Tapestry Weaver, appear to me to be the same
person; but this is only an opinion, for &#8216;full nine
and twenty&#8217; may signify one more or less. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
I daresay that Chaucer wrote &#8216;A Webbe Dyer&#8217;,
that is a Cloth Dyer:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A Webbe Dyer and a Tapiser.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Merchant cannot be one of the Three
Citizens, as his dress is different, and his character
is more marked, whereas Chaucer says of his rich
citizens:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All were yclothed in o liverie.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The characters of Women Chaucer has divided
into two classes, the Lady Prioress and the Wife
of Bath. Are not these leaders of the ages of men?
The Lady Prioress in some ages predominates;
and in some the Wife of Bath, in whose character
Chaucer has been equally minute and exact;
because she is also a scourge and a blight. I shall
say no more of her, nor expose what Chaucer has
left hidden; let the young reader study what he
has said of her: it is useful as a scarecrow.
There are of such characters born too many for the
peace of the world.</p>

<p>I come at length to the Clerk of Oxenford. This
character varies from that of Chaucer, as the contemplative
philosopher varies from the poetical
genius. There are always these two classes of
learned sages, the poetical and the philosophical.
The Painter has put them side by side, as if the
youthful clerk had put himself under the tuition
of the mature poet. Let the Philosopher always
be the servant and scholar of Inspiration, and all
will be happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Taking</span> a turn the other day in the Abbey, I was
struck with the affected attitude of a figure, which
I do not remember to have seen before, and which
upon examination proved to be a whole-length of
the celebrated Mr. Garrick. Though I would not
go so far with some good Catholics abroad as to
shut players altogether out of consecrated ground,
yet I own I was not a little scandalized at the introduction
of theatrical airs and gestures into a
place set apart to remind us of the saddest realities.
Going nearer, I found inscribed under this harlequin
figure the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To paint fair Nature, by divine command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her magic pencil in his glowing hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Shakespeare rose: then, to expand his fame<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Shakespeare and Garrick like twin-stars shall shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And earth irradiate with a beam divine.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It would be an insult to my readers&#8217; understandings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
to attempt anything like a criticism on
this farrago of false thoughts and nonsense. But
the reflection it led me into was a kind of wonder,
how, from the days of the actor here celebrated to
our own, it should have been the fashion to compliment
every performer in his turn, that has had
the luck to please the town in any of the great
characters of Shakespeare, with the notion of possessing
a <i>mind congenial with the poet&#8217;s</i>: how people
should come thus unaccountably to confound the
power of originating poetical images and conceptions
with the faculty of being able to read or recite
the same when put into words;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> or what connexion
that absolute mastery over the heart and soul of
man, which a great dramatic poet possesses, has
with those low tricks upon the eye and ear, which
a player by observing a few general effects,
which some common passion, as grief, anger, &amp;c.
usually has upon the gestures and exterior, can so
easily compass. To know the internal workings
and movements of a great mind, of an Othello or a
Hamlet for instance, the <i>when</i> and the <i>why</i> and the
<i>how far</i> they should be moved; to what pitch a
passion is becoming; to give the reins and to pull
in the curb exactly at the moment when the drawing
in or the slackening is most graceful; seems to
demand a reach of intellect of a vastly different
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>extent from that which is employed upon the bare
imitation of the signs of these passions in the
countenance or gesture, which signs are usually
observed to be most lively and emphatic in the
weaker sort of minds, and which signs can after all
but indicate some passion, as I said before, anger,
or grief, generally; but of the motives and grounds
of the passion, wherein it differs from the same
passion in low and vulgar natures, of these the
actor can give no more idea by his face or gesture
than the eye (without a metaphor) can speak, or the
muscles utter intelligible sounds. But such is the
instantaneous nature of the impressions which we
take in at the eye and ear at a playhouse, compared
with the slow apprehension oftentimes of the understanding
in reading, that we are apt not only to
sink the play-writer in the consideration which we
pay to the actor, but even to identify in our minds
in a perverse manner, the actor with the character
which he represents. It is difficult for a frequent
playgoer to disembarrass the idea of Hamlet from
the person and voice of Mr. K. We speak of Lady
Macbeth, while we are in reality thinking of Mrs. S.
Nor is this confusion incidental alone to unlettered
persons, who, not possessing the advantage of
reading, are necessarily dependent upon the stage-player
for all the pleasure which they can receive
from the drama, and to whom the very idea of <i>what
an author is</i> cannot be made comprehensible without
some pain and perplexity of mind: the error
is one from which persons otherwise not meanly
lettered, find it almost impossible to extricate
themselves.</p>

<p>Never let me be so ungrateful as to forget the
very high degree of satisfaction which I received<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
some years back from seeing for the first time a
tragedy of Shakespeare performed, in which these
two great performers sustained the principal parts.
It seemed to embody and realize conceptions which
had hitherto assumed no distinct shape. But
dearly do we pay all our life after for this juvenile
pleasure, this sense of distinctness. When the
novelty is past, we find to our cost that instead of
realizing an idea, we have only materialized and
brought down a fine vision to the standard of flesh
and blood. We have let go a dream, in quest of an
unattainable substance.</p>

<p>How cruelly this operates upon the mind, to have
its free conceptions thus crampt and pressed down
to the measure of a strait-lacing actuality, may be
judged from that delightful sensation of freshness
with which we turn to those plays of Shakespeare
which have escaped being performed, and to those
passages in the acting plays of the same writer
which have happily been left out in performance.
How far the very custom of hearing anything
<i>spouted</i>, withers and blows upon a fine passage,
may be seen in those speeches from <i>Henry the Fifth</i>,
&amp;c. which are current in the mouths of school-boys
from their being to be found in <i>Enfield Speakers</i>,
and such kind of books. I confess myself utterly
unable to appreciate that celebrated soliloquy in
<i>Hamlet</i>, beginning &#8216;To be or not to be&#8217;, or to tell
whether it be good, bad, or indifferent, it has been
so handled and pawed about by declamatory boys
and men, and torn so inhumanly from its living
place and principle of continuity in the play, till
it is become to me a perfect dead member.</p>

<p>It may seem a paradox, but I cannot help being
of opinion that the plays of Shakespeare are less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
calculated for performance on a stage, than those
of almost any other dramatist whatever. Their
distinguished excellence is a reason that they should
be so. There is so much in them, which comes not
under the province of acting, with which eye, and
tone, and gesture, have nothing to do.</p>

<p>The glory of the scenic art is to personate passion,
and the turns of passion; and the more coarse and
palpable the passion is, the more hold upon the eyes
and ears of the spectators the performer obviously
possesses. For this reason, scolding scenes, scenes
where two persons talk themselves into a fit of fury,
and then in a surprising manner talk themselves
out of it again, have always been the most popular
upon our stage. And the reason is plain, because
the spectators are here most palpably appealed to,
they are the proper judges in this war of words,
they are the legitimate ring that should be formed
round such &#8216;intellectual prize-fighters&#8217;. Talking
is the direct object of the imitation here. But in
all the best dramas, and in Shakespeare above all,
how obvious it is, that the form of <i>speaking</i>,
whether it be in soliloquy or dialogue, is only a
medium, and often a highly artificial one, for putting
the reader or spectator into possession of that
knowledge of the inner structure and workings of
mind in a character, which he could otherwise
never have arrived at <i>in that form of composition</i>
by any gift short of intuition. We do here as we
do with novels written in the <i>epistolary form</i>.
How many improprieties, perfect solecisms in
letter-writing, do we put up with in <i>Clarissa</i> and
other books, for the sake of the delight which that
form upon the whole gives us.</p>

<p>But the practice of stage representation reduces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
everything to a controversy of elocution. Every
character, from the boisterous blasphemings of
Bajazet to the shrinking timidity of womanhood,
must play the orator. The love-dialogues of
Romeo and Juliet, those silver-sweet sounds of
lovers&#8217; tongues by night; the more intimate and
sacred sweetness of nuptial colloquy between an
Othello or a Posthumus with their married wives,
all those delicacies which are so delightful in the
reading, as when we read of those youthful dalliances
in Paradise</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i9">As beseem&#8217;d<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair couple link&#8217;d in happy nuptial league<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone:<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">by the inherent fault of stage representation, how
are these things sullied and turned from their very
nature by being exposed to a large assembly;
when such speeches as Imogen addresses to her
lord, come drawling out of the mouth of a hired
actress, whose courtship, though nominally addressed
to the personated Posthumus, is manifestly
aimed at the spectators, who are to judge of
her endearments and her returns of love.</p>

<p>The character of Hamlet is perhaps that by
which, since the days of Betterton, a succession of
popular performers have had the greatest ambition
to distinguish themselves. The length of the part
may be one of their reasons. But for the character
itself, we find it in a play, and therefore we judge
it a fit subject of dramatic representation. The
play itself abounds in maxims and reflections
beyond any other, and therefore we consider it as
a proper vehicle for conveying moral instruction.
But Hamlet himself&mdash;what does he suffer meanwhile
by being dragged forth as a public schoolmaster,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
to give lectures to the crowd! Why, nine
parts in ten of what Hamlet does, are transactions
between himself and his moral sense, they are the
effusions of his solitary musings, which he retires
to holes and corners and the most sequestered parts
of the palace to pour forth; or rather, they are
the silent meditations with which his bosom is
bursting, reduced to <i>words</i> for the sake of the reader,
who must else remain ignorant of what is passing
there. These profound sorrows, these light-and-noise-abhorring
ruminations, which the tongue
scarce dares utter to deaf walls and chambers, how
can they be represented by a gesticulating actor,
who comes and mouths them out before an audience,
making four hundred people his confidants
at once? I say not that it is the fault of the actor
so to do; he must pronounce them <i>ore rotundo</i>,
he must accompany them with his eye, he must
insinuate them into his auditory by some trick of
eye, tone, or gesture, or he fails. <i>He must be
thinking all the while of his appearance, because he
knows that all the while the spectators are judging of
it.</i> And this is the way to represent the shy,
negligent, retiring Hamlet.</p>

<p>It is true that there is no other mode of conveying
a vast quantity of thought and feeling to
a great portion of the audience, who otherwise
would never earn it for themselves by reading, and
the intellectual acquisition gained this way may,
for aught I know, be inestimable; but I am not
arguing that Hamlet should not be acted, but how
much Hamlet is made another thing by being
acted. I have heard much of the wonders which
Garrick performed in this part; but as I never
saw him, I must have leave to doubt whether the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
representation of such a character came within the
province of his art. Those who tell me of him,
speak of his eye, of the magic of his eye, and of
his commanding voice: physical properties, vastly
desirable in an actor, and without which he can
never insinuate meaning into an auditory,&mdash;but
what have they to do with Hamlet? what have
they to do with intellect? In fact, the things
aimed at in theatrical representation, are to arrest
the spectator&#8217;s eye upon the form and the gesture,
and so to gain a more favourable hearing to what
is spoken: it is not what the character is, but how
he looks; not what he says, but how he speaks it.
I see no reason to think that if the play of <i>Hamlet</i>
were written over again by some such writer as
Banks or Lillo, retaining the process of the story,
but totally omitting all the poetry of it, all the
divine features of Shakespeare, his stupendous intellect;
and only taking care to give us enough of
passionate dialogue, which Banks or Lillo were never
at a loss to furnish; I see not how the effect could
be much different upon an audience, nor how the
actor has it in his power to represent Shakespeare
to us differently from his representation of Banks
or Lillo. Hamlet would still be a youthful accomplished
prince, and must be gracefully personated;
he might be puzzled in his mind, wavering in his
conduct, seemingly-cruel to Ophelia, he might see
a ghost, and start at it, and address it kindly when
he found it to be his father; all this in the poorest
and most homely language of the servilest creeper
after nature that ever consulted the palate of an
audience; without troubling Shakespeare for the
matter: and I see not but there would be room for
all the power which an actor has, to display itself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
All the passions and changes of passion might remain:
for those are much less difficult to write or
act than is thought, it is a trick easy to be attained,
it is but rising or falling a note or two in the voice,
a whisper with a significant foreboding look to
announce its approach, and so contagious the
counterfeit appearance of any emotion is, that let
the words be what they will, the look and tone
shall carry it off and make it pass for deep skill in
the passions.</p>

<p>It is common for people to talk of Shakespeare&#8217;s
plays being <i>so natural</i>; that everybody can understand
him. They are natural indeed, they are
grounded deep in nature, so deep that the depth of
them lies out of the reach of most of us. You
shall hear the same persons say that George
Barnwell is very natural, and Othello is very
natural, that they are both very deep; and to
them they are the same kind of thing. At the one
they sit and shed tears, because a good sort of
young man is tempted by a naughty woman to
commit <i>a trifling peccadillo</i>, the murder of an uncle
or so, that is all, and so comes to an untimely end,
which is <i>so moving</i>; and at the other, because a
blackamoor in a fit of jealousy kills his innocent
white wife: and the odds are that ninety-nine out
of a hundred would willingly behold the same
catastrophe happen to both the heroes, and have
thought the rope more due to Othello than to
Barnwell. For of the texture of Othello&#8217;s mind,
the inward construction marvellously laid open
with all its strengths and weaknesses, its heroic
confidences and its human misgivings, its agonies
of hate springing from the depths of love, they see
no more than the spectators at a cheaper rate,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
who pay their pennies a-piece to look through the
man&#8217;s telescope in Leicester-fields, see into the
inward plot and topography of the moon. Some
dim thing or other they see, they see an actor personating
a passion, of grief, or anger, for instance,
and they recognize it as a copy of the usual external
effects of such passions; for at least as
being true to <i>that symbol of the emotion which passes
current at the theatre for it</i>, for it is often no more
than that: but of the grounds of the passion, its
correspondence to a great or heroic nature, which
is the only worthy object of tragedy,&mdash;that common
auditors know any thing of this, or can have
any such notions dinned into them by the mere
strength of an actor&#8217;s lungs,&mdash;that apprehensions
foreign to them should be thus infused into them
by storm, I can neither believe, nor understand
how it can be possible.</p>

<p>We talk of Shakespeare&#8217;s admirable observation
of life, when we should feel, that not from a petty
inquisition into those cheap and every-day characters
which surrounded him, as they surround us,
but from his own mind, which was, to borrow
a phrase of Ben Jonson&#8217;s, the very &#8216;sphere of
humanity&#8217;, he fetched those images of virtue and
of knowledge, of which every one of us recognizing
a part, think we comprehend in our natures the
whole; and oftentimes mistake the powers which
he positively creates in us, for nothing more than
indigenous faculties of our own minds which only
waited the action of corresponding virtues in him
to return a full and clear echo of the same.</p>

<p>To return to Hamlet.&mdash;Among the distinguishing
features of that wonderful character, one of the
most interesting (yet painful) is that soreness of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
mind which makes him treat the intrusions of
Polonius with harshness, and that asperity which
he puts on in his interviews with Ophelia. These
tokens of an unhinged mind (if they be not mixed in
the latter case with a profound artifice of love, to
alienate Ophelia by affected discourtesies, so to
prepare her mind for the breaking off of that loving
intercourse, which can no longer find a place
amidst business so serious as that which he has to
do) are parts of his character, which to reconcile
with our admiration of Hamlet, the most patient
consideration of his situation is no more than necessary;
they are what we <i>forgive afterwards</i>, and
explain by the whole of his character, but <i>at the
time</i> they are harsh and unpleasant. Yet such is
the actor&#8217;s necessity of giving strong blows to the
audience, that I have never seen a player in this
character, who did not exaggerate and strain to
the utmost these ambiguous features,&mdash;these temporary
deformities in the character. They make
him express a vulgar scorn at Polonius which
utterly degrades his gentility, and which no explanation
can render palatable; they make him
show contempt, and curl up the nose at Ophelia&#8217;s
father,&mdash;contempt in its very grossest and most
hateful form; but they get applause by it: it is
natural, people say; that is, the words are scornful,
and the actor expresses scorn, and that they
can judge of: but why so much scorn, and of that
sort, they never think of asking.</p>

<p>So to Ophelia.&mdash;All the Hamlets that I have
ever seen, rant and rave at her as if she had committed
some great crime, and the audience are
highly pleased, because the words of the part are
satirical, and they are enforced by the strongest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
expression of satirical indignation of which the face
and voice are capable. But then, whether Hamlet
is likely to have put on such brutal appearances
to a lady whom he loved so dearly, is never thought
on. The truth is, that in all such deep affections
as had subsisted between Hamlet and Ophelia,
there is a stock of <i>supererogatory love</i>, (if I may
venture to use the expression) which in any great
grief of heart, especially where that which preys
upon the mind cannot be communicated, confers
a kind of indulgence upon the grieved party to
express itself, even to its heart&#8217;s dearest object,
in the language of a temporary alienation; but
it is not alienation, it is a distraction purely, and
so it always makes itself to be felt by that object:
it is not anger, but grief assuming the appearance
of anger,&mdash;love awkwardly counterfeiting hate, as
sweet countenances when they try to frown: but
such sternness and fierce disgust as Hamlet is made
to show, is no counterfeit, but the real face of
absolute aversion,&mdash;of irreconcilable alienation.
It may be said he puts on the madman; but then
he should only so far put on this counterfeit lunacy
as his own real distraction will give him leave;
that is, incompletely, imperfectly; not in that
confirmed practised way, like a master of his art,
or, as Dame Quickly would say, &#8216;like one of those
harlotry players.&#8217;</p>

<p>I mean no disrespect to any actor, but the sort
of pleasure which Shakespeare&#8217;s plays give in the
acting seems to me not at all to differ from that
which the audience receive from those of other
writers; and, <i>they being in themselves essentially so
different from all others</i>, I must conclude that there
is something in the nature of acting which levels<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
all distinctions. And in fact, who does not speak
indifferently of the <i>Gamester</i> and of <i>Macbeth</i> as
fine stage performances, and praise the Mrs. Beverley
in the same way as the Lady Macbeth of
Mrs. S.? Belvidera, and Calista, and Isabella,
and Euphrasia, are they less liked than Imogen,
or than Juliet, or than Desdemona? Are they
not spoken of and remembered in the same way?
Is not the female performer as great (as they call
it) in one as in the other? Did not Garrick shine,
and was not he ambitious of shining in every
drawling tragedy that his wretched day produced,&mdash;the
productions of the Hills and the Murphys
and the Browns,&mdash;and shall he have that honour
to dwell in our minds for ever as an inseparable
concomitant with Shakespeare? A kindred mind!
O who can read that affecting sonnet of Shakespeare
which alludes to his profession as a player:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh for my sake do you with Fortune chide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That did not better for my life provide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than public means which public custom breeds&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thence comes it that my name receives a brand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And almost thence my nature is subdued<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To what it works in, like the dyer&#8217;s hand&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Or that other confession:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Alas! &#8217;tis true, I have gone here and there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made myself a motley to thy view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gor&#8217;d mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Who can read these instances of jealous self-watchfulness
in our sweet Shakespeare, and dream
of any congeniality between him and one that, by
every tradition of him, appears to have been as
mere a player as ever existed; to have had his
mind tainted with the lowest players&#8217; vices,&mdash;envy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and jealousy, and miserable cravings after applause;
one who in the exercise of his profession was jealous
even of the women-performers that stood in his
way; a manager full of managerial tricks and
stratagems and finesse: that any resemblance
should be dreamed of between him and Shakespeare,&mdash;Shakespeare
who, in the plenitude and
consciousness of his own powers, could with that
noble modesty, which we can neither imitate nor
appreciate, express himself thus of his own sense
of his own defects:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Featur&#8217;d like him, like him with friends possest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Desiring <i>this man&#8217;s art, and that man&#8217;s scope</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I am almost disposed to deny to Garrick the
merit of being an admirer of Shakespeare. A true
lover of his excellences he certainly was not; for
would any true lover of them have admitted into
his matchless scenes such ribald trash as Tate and
Cibber, and the rest of them, that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With their darkness durst affront his light,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">have foisted into the acting plays of Shakespeare?
I believe it impossible that he could have had
a proper reverence for Shakespeare, and have
condescended to go through that interpolated
scene in Richard the Third, in which Richard
tries to break his wife&#8217;s heart by telling her he
loves another woman, and says, &#8216;if she survives
this she is immortal.&#8217; Yet I doubt not he delivered
this vulgar stuff with as much anxiety of emphasis
as any of the genuine parts; and for acting, it is
as well calculated as any. But we have seen the
part of Richard lately produce great fame to an
actor by his manner of playing it, and it lets us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
into the secret of acting, and of popular judgements
of Shakespeare derived from acting. Not one of
the spectators who have witnessed Mr. C.&#8217;s
exertions in that part, but has come away with
a proper conviction that Richard is a very wicked
man, and kills little children in their beds, with
something like the pleasure which the giants and
ogres in children&#8217;s books are represented to have
taken in that practice; moreover, that he is very
close and shrewd and devilish cunning, for you
could see that by his eye.</p>

<p>But is in fact this the impression we have in
reading the Richard of Shakespeare? Do we feel
anything like disgust, as we do at that butcher-like
representation of him that passes for him on the
stage? A horror at his crimes blends with the
effect which we feel, but how is it qualified, how is
it carried off, by the rich intellect which he displays,
his resources, his wit, his buoyant spirits, his vast
knowledge and insight into characters, the poetry
of his part,&mdash;not an atom of all which is made
perceivable in Mr. C.&#8217;s way of acting it. Nothing
but his crimes, his actions, is visible; they are
prominent and staring; the murderer stands out,
but where is the lofty genius, the man of vast
capacity,&mdash;the profound, the witty, accomplished
Richard?</p>

<p>The truth is, the Characters of Shakespeare are
so much the objects of meditation rather than of
interest or curiosity as to their actions, that while
we are reading any of his great criminal characters,&mdash;Macbeth,
Richard, even Iago,&mdash;we think not
so much of the crimes which they commit, as of
the ambition, the aspiring spirit, the intellectual
activity, which prompts them to overleap those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
moral fences. Barnwell is a wretched murderer;
there is a certain fitness between his neck and the
rope; he is the legitimate heir to the gallows;
nobody who thinks at all can think of any alleviating
circumstances in his case to make him a fit object
of mercy. Or to take an instance from the higher
tragedy, what else but a mere assassin is Glenalvon!
Do we think of anything but of the crime which he
commits, and the rack which he deserves? That
is all which we really think about him. Whereas
in corresponding characters in Shakespeare so little
do the actions comparatively affect us, that while the
impulses, the inner mind in all its perverted greatness,
solely seems real and is exclusively attended to,
the crime is comparatively nothing. But when we
see these things represented, the acts which they
do are comparatively everything, their impulses
nothing. The state of sublime emotion into which
we are elevated by those images of night and horror
which Macbeth is made to utter, that solemn
prelude with which he entertains the time till the
bell shall strike which is to call him to murder
Duncan,&mdash;when we no longer read it in a book,
when we have given up that vantage-ground of
abstraction which reading possesses over seeing,
and come to see a man in his bodily shape before
our eyes actually preparing to commit a murder,
if the acting be true and impressive, as I have
witnessed it in Mr. K.&#8217;s performance of that part,
the painful anxiety about the act, the natural
longing to prevent it while it yet seems unperpetrated,
the too close pressing semblance of
reality, give a pain and an uneasiness which
totally destroy all the delight which the words in
the book convey, where the deed doing never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
presses upon us with the painful sense of presence:
it rather seems to belong to history,&mdash;to something
past and inevitable, if it has anything to do with
time at all. The sublime images, the poetry alone,
is that which is present to our minds in the reading.</p>

<p>So to see Lear acted&mdash;to see an old man tottering
about the stage with a walking-stick, turned out
of doors by his daughters in a rainy night, has
nothing in it but what is painful and disgusting.
We want to take him into shelter and relieve him.
That is all the feeling which the acting of Lear
ever produced in me. But the Lear of Shakespeare
cannot be acted. The contemptible machinery
by which they mimic the storm which he goes
out in, is not more inadequate to represent the
horrors of the real elements, than any actor can
be to represent Lear: they might more easily
propose to personate the Satan of Milton upon
a stage, or one of Michael Angelo&#8217;s terrible figures.
The greatness of Lear is not in corporal dimension,
but in intellectual: the explosions of his passion
are terrible as a volcano: they are storms turning
up and disclosing to the bottom that sea, his mind,
with all its vast riches. It is his mind which is
laid bare. This case of flesh and blood seems too
insignificant to be thought on; even as he himself
neglects it. On the stage we see nothing but
corporal infirmities and weakness, the impotence
of rage; while we read it, we see not Lear, but we
are Lear,&mdash;we are in his mind, we are sustained by
a grandeur which baffles the malice of daughters
and storms; in the aberrations of his reason, we
discover a mighty irregular power of reasoning,
immethodized from the ordinary purposes of life,
but exerting its powers, as the wind blows where it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
listeth, at will upon the corruptions and abuses of
mankind. What have looks, or tones, to do with
that sublime identification of his age with that of
the <i>heavens themselves</i>, when in his reproaches to
them for conniving at the injustice of his children,
he reminds them that &#8216;they themselves are old&#8217;.
What gesture shall we appropriate to this? What
has the voice or the eye to do with such things?
But the play is beyond all art, as the tamperings
with it show: it is too hard and stony; it must
have love-scenes, and a happy ending. It is not
enough that Cordelia is a daughter, she must shine
as a lover too. Tate has put his hook in the nostrils
of this Leviathan, for Garrick and his followers,
the showmen of the scene, to draw the mighty
beast about more easily. A happy ending!&mdash;as if
the living martyrdom that Lear had gone through,&mdash;the
flaying of his feelings alive, did not make
a fair dismissal from the stage of life the only
decorous thing for him. If he is to live and be
happy after, if he could sustain this world&#8217;s burden
after, why all this pudder and preparation,&mdash;why
torment us with all this unnecessary sympathy?
As if the childish pleasure of getting his gilt robes
and sceptre again could tempt him to act over
again his misused station,&mdash;as if at his years, and
with his experience, anything was left but to die.</p>

<p>Lear is essentially impossible to be represented
on a stage. But how many dramatic personages
are there in Shakespeare, which though more
tractable and feasible (if I may so speak) than
Lear, yet from some circumstance, some adjunct
to their character, are improper to be shown to
our bodily eye. Othello for instance. Nothing can
be more soothing, more flattering to the nobler<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
parts of our natures, than to read of a young
Venetian lady of highest extraction, through the
force of love and from a sense of merit in him whom
she loved, laying aside every consideration of
kindred, and country, and colour, and wedding
with <i>a coal-black Moor</i>&mdash;(for such he is represented,
in the imperfect state of knowledge respecting
foreign countries in those days, compared with
our own, or in compliance with popular notions,
though the Moors are now well enough known to
be by many shades less unworthy of a white
woman&#8217;s fancy)&mdash;it is the perfect triumph of virtue
over accidents, of the imagination over the senses.
She sees Othello&#8217;s colour in his mind. But upon
the stage, when the imagination is no longer the
ruling faculty, but we are left to our poor unassisted
senses, I appeal to every one that has seen Othello
played, whether he did not, on the contrary, sink
Othello&#8217;s mind in his colour; whether he did not
find something extremely revolting in the courtship
and wedded caresses of Othello and Desdemona;
and whether the actual sight of the thing did not
over-weigh all that beautiful compromise which
we make in reading;&mdash;and the reason it should do
so is obvious, because there is just so much reality
presented to our senses as to give a perception of
disagreement, with not enough of belief in the
internal motives&mdash;all that which is unseen&mdash;to
overpower and reconcile the first and obvious
prejudices.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> What we see upon a stage is body
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>and bodily action; what we are conscious of in
reading is almost exclusively the mind, and its
movements: and this I think may sufficiently
account for the very different sort of delight with
which the same play so often affects us in the
reading and the seeing.</p>

<p>It requires little reflection to perceive, that if
those characters in Shakespeare which are within
the precincts of nature, have yet something in
them which appeals too exclusively to the imagination,
to admit of their being made objects to the
senses without suffering a change and a diminution,&mdash;that
still stronger the objection must lie against
representing another line of characters, which
Shakespeare has introduced to give a wildness and
a supernatural elevation to his scenes, as if to
remove them still farther from that assimilation
to common life in which their excellence is vulgarly
supposed to consist. When we read the incantations
of those terrible beings the Witches in <i>Macbeth</i>,
though some of the ingredients of their hellish composition
savour of the grotesque, yet is the effect
upon us other than the most serious and appalling
that can be imagined? Do we not feel spell-bound
as Macbeth was? Can any mirth accompany
a sense of their presence? We might as well laugh
under a consciousness of the principle of Evil
himself being truly and really present with us.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>But attempt to bring these beings on to a stage,
and you turn them instantly into so many old
women, that men and children are to laugh at.
Contrary to the old saying, that &#8216;seeing is believing&#8217;,
the sight actually destroys the faith; and the
mirth in which we indulge at their expense, when
we see these creatures upon a stage, seems to be
a sort of indemnification which we make to
ourselves for the terror which they put us in when
reading made them an object of belief,&mdash;when we
surrendered up our reason to the poet, as children,
to their nurses and their elders; and we laugh at
our fears, as children who thought they saw
something in the dark, triumph when the bringing
in of a candle discovers the vanity of their fears.
For this exposure of supernatural agents upon
a stage is truly bringing in a candle to expose
their own delusiveness. It is the solitary taper
and the book that generates a faith in these terrors:
a ghost by chandelier light, and in good company,
deceives no spectators,&mdash;a ghost that can be
measured by the eye, and his human dimensions
made out at leisure. The sight of a well-lighted
house, and a well-dressed audience, shall arm the
most nervous child against any apprehensions:
as Tom Brown says of the impenetrable skin of
Achilles with his impenetrable armour over it,
&#8216;Bully Dawson would have fought the devil with
such advantages.&#8217;</p>

<p>Much has been said, and deservedly, in reprobation
of the vile mixture which Dryden has thrown
into the <i>Tempest</i>: doubtless without some such
vicious alloy, the impure ears of that age would
never have sate out to hear so much innocence of
love as is contained in the sweet courtship of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Ferdinand and Miranda. But is the <i>Tempest</i> of
Shakespeare at all a subject for stage representation?
It is one thing to read of an enchanter, and to
believe the wondrous tale while we are reading it;
but to have a conjurer brought before us in his
conjuring-gown, with his spirits about him, which
none but himself and some hundred of favoured
spectators before the curtain are supposed to see,
involves such a quantity of the <i>hateful incredible</i>,
that all our reverence for the author cannot hinder
us from perceiving such gross attempts upon the
senses to be in the highest degree childish and inefficient.
Spirits and fairies cannot be represented,
they cannot even be painted,&mdash;they can only be
believed. But the elaborate and anxious provision
of scenery, which the luxury of the age demands,
in these cases works a quite contrary effect to
what is intended. That which in comedy, or plays
of familiar life, adds so much to the life of the
imitation, in plays which appeal to the higher
faculties, positively destroys the illusion which it
is introduced to aid. A parlour or a drawing-room,&mdash;a
library opening into a garden,&mdash;a garden
with an alcove in it,&mdash;a street, or the piazza of
Covent Garden, does well enough in a scene; we
are content to give as much credit to it as it
demands; or rather, we think little about it,&mdash;it
is little more than reading at the top of a page,
&#8216;Scene, a Garden;&#8217; we do not imagine ourselves
there, but we readily admit the imitation of
familiar objects. But to think by the help of
painted trees and caverns, which we know to be
painted, to transport our minds to Prospero, and
his island and his lonely cell;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> or by the aid of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>a fiddle dexterously thrown in, in an interval of
speaking, to make us believe that we hear those
supernatural noises of which the isle was full:&mdash;the
Orrery Lecturer at the Haymarket might as
well hope, by his musical glasses cleverly stationed
out of sight behind his apparatus, to make us
believe that we do indeed hear the chrystal spheres
ring out that chime, which if it were to inwrap our
fancy long, Milton thinks,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Time would run back and fetch the age of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And speckled vanity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would sicken soon and die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leprous Sin would melt from earthly mould;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea Hell itself would pass away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave its dolorous mansions to the peering day.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">The Garden of Eden, with our first parents in it,
is not more impossible to be shown on a stage,
than the Enchanted Isle, with its no less interesting
and innocent first settlers.</p>

<p>The subject of Scenery is closely connected with
that of the Dresses, which are so anxiously attended
to on our stage. I remember the last time I saw
Macbeth played, the discrepancy I felt at the
changes of garment which he varied&mdash;the shiftings
and re-shiftings, like a Romish priest at mass.
The luxury of stage-improvements, and the importunity
of the public eye, require this. The
coronation robe of the Scottish monarch was
fairly a counterpart to that which our king wears
when he goes to the Parliament-house,&mdash;just so
full and cumbersome, and set out with ermine
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>and pearls. And if things must be represented,
I see not what to find fault with in this. But in
reading, what robe are we conscious of? Some
dim images of royalty&mdash;a crown and sceptre, may
float before our eyes, but who shall describe the
fashion of it? Do we see in our mind&#8217;s eye what
Webb or any other robe-maker could pattern?
This is the inevitable consequence of imitating
everything, to make all things natural. Whereas
the reading of a tragedy is a fine abstraction. It
presents to the fancy just so much of external
appearances as to make us feel that we are among
flesh and blood, while by far the greater and
better part of our imagination is employed upon
the thoughts and internal machinery of the
character. But in acting, scenery, dress, the
most contemptible things, call upon us to judge
of their naturalness.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be no bad similitude, to liken
the pleasure which we take in seeing one of these
fine plays acted, compared with that quiet delight
which we find in the reading of it, to the different
feelings with which a reviewer, and a man that is
not a reviewer, reads a fine poem. The accursed
critical habit,&mdash;the being called upon to judge and
pronounce, must make it quite a different thing
to the former. In seeing these plays acted, we
are affected just as judges. When Hamlet
compares the two pictures of Gertrude&#8217;s first and
second husband, who wants to see the pictures?
But in the acting, a miniature must be lugged out;
which we know not to be the picture, but only to
show how finely a miniature may be represented.
This showing of everything, levels all things: it
makes tricks, bows, and curtesies, of importance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Mrs. S. never got more fame by anything than by
the manner in which she dismisses the guests in
the banquet-scene in <i>Macbeth</i>: it is as much
remembered as any of her thrilling tones or
impressive looks. But does such a trifle as this
enter into the imaginations of the readers of that
wild and wonderful scene? Does not the mind
dismiss the feasters as rapidly as it can? Does
it care about the gracefulness of the doing it?
But by acting, and judging of acting, all these non-essentials
are raised into an importance, injurious
to the main interest of the play.</p>

<p>I have confined my observations to the tragic
parts of Shakespeare. It would be no very difficult
task to extend the inquiry to his comedies;
and to show why Falstaff, Shallow, Sir Hugh Evans,
and the rest, are equally incompatible with stage
representation. The length to which this essay
has run, will make it, I am afraid, sufficiently
distasteful to the Amateurs of the Theatre, without
going any deeper into the subject at present.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> It is observable that we fall into this confusion only in
<i>dramatic</i> recitations. We never dream that the gentleman
who reads Lucretius in public with great applause, is therefore
a great poet and philosopher; nor do we find that Tom
Davies, the bookseller, who is recorded to have recited the
<i>Paradise Lost</i> better than any man in England in his day
(though I cannot help thinking there must be some mistake
in this tradition), was therefore, by his intimate friends, set
upon a level with Milton.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> The error of supposing that because Othello&#8217;s colour
does not offend us in the reading, it should also not offend
us in the seeing, is just such a fallacy as supposing that an
Adam and Eve in a picture shall affect us just as they do in
the poem. But in the poem we for a while have Paradisaical
senses given us, which vanish when we see a man and his
wife without clothes in the picture. The painters themselves
feel this, as is apparent by the awkward shifts they
have recourse to, to make them look not quite naked; by
a sort of prophetic anachronism, antedating the invention

<h3>A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821)</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">According</span> to one mode of regarding those two
classes of mental action, which are called reason
and imagination, the former may be considered as
mind contemplating the relations borne by one
thought to another, however produced; and the
latter, as mind acting upon those thoughts so as to
colour them with its own light, and composing
from them, as from elements, other thoughts, each
containing within itself the principle of its own
integrity. The one is the &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#949;&#8150;&#957;, or the principle
of synthesis, and has for its objects those
forms which are common to universal nature and
existence itself; the other is the &#964;&#8056; &#955;&#959;&#947;&#8055;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;, or
principle of analysis, and its action regards the
relations of things, simply as relations; considering
thoughts, not in their integral unity, but as the
algebraical representations which conduct to certain
general results. Reason is the enumeration
of quantities already known; imagination is the
perception of the value of those quantities, both
separately and as a whole. Reason respects the
differences, and imagination the similitudes of
things. Reason is to the imagination as the instrument
to the agent, as the body to the spirit, as the
shadow to the substance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Poetry, in a general sense, may be defined to be
&#8216;the expression of the imagination&#8217;: and poetry
is connate with the origin of man. Man is an
instrument over which a series of external and
internal impressions are driven, like the alternations
of an ever-changing wind over an Aeolian lyre,
which move it by their motion to ever-changing
melody. But there is a principle within the human
being, and perhaps within all sentient beings, which
acts otherwise than in the lyre, and produces not
melody alone, but harmony, by an internal adjustment
of the sounds or motions thus excited to
the impressions which excite them. It is as if the
lyre could accommodate its chords to the motions
of that which strikes them, in a determined proportion
of sound; even as the musician can accommodate
his voice to the sound of the lyre. A child
at play by itself will express its delight by its voice
and motions; and every inflexion of tone and every
gesture will bear exact relation to a corresponding
antitype in the pleasurable impressions which
awakened it; it will be the reflected image of that
impression; and as the lyre trembles and sounds
after the wind has died away, so the child seeks, by
prolonging in its voice and motions the duration of
the effect, to prolong also a consciousness of the
cause. In relation to the objects which delight
a child, these expressions are, what poetry is to
higher objects. The savage (for the savage is to
ages what the child is to years) expresses the
emotions produced in him by surrounding objects
in a similar manner; and language and gesture,
together with plastic or pictorial imitation, become
the image of the combined effect of those objects,
and of his apprehension of them. Man in society,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
with all his passions and his pleasures, next becomes
the object of the passions and pleasures of
man; an additional class of emotions produces an
augmented treasure of expressions; and language,
gesture, and the imitative arts, become at once
the representation and the medium, the pencil and
the picture, the chisel and the statue, the chord
and the harmony. The social sympathies, or those
laws from which, as from its elements, society
results, begin to develop themselves from the
moment that two human beings coexist; the future
is contained within the present, as the plant within
the seed; and equality, diversity, unity, contrast,
mutual dependence, become the principles alone
capable of affording the motives according to which
the will of a social being is determined to action,
inasmuch as he is social; and constitute pleasure
in sensation, virtue in sentiment, beauty in art,
truth in reasoning, and love in the intercourse of
kind. Hence men, even in the infancy of society,
observe a certain order in their words and actions,
distinct from that of the objects and the impressions
represented by them, all expression being subject
to the laws of that from which it proceeds. But
let us dismiss those more general considerations
which might involve an inquiry into the principles
of society itself, and restrict our view to the manner
in which the imagination is expressed upon its forms.</p>

<p>In the youth of the world, men dance and sing
and imitate natural objects, observing in these
actions, as in all others, a certain rhythm or order.
And, although all men observe a similar, they
observe not the same order, in the motions of the
dance, in the melody of the song, in the combinations
of language, in the series of their imitations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of natural objects. For there is a certain order
or rhythm belonging to each of these classes of
mimetic representation, from which the hearer and
the spectator receive an intenser and purer pleasure
than from any other: the sense of an approximation
to this order has been called taste by
modern writers. Every man in the infancy of art
observes an order which approximates more or
less closely to that from which this highest delight
results: but the diversity is not sufficiently marked,
as that its gradations should be sensible, except in
those instances where the predominance of this
faculty of approximation to the beautiful (for so
we may be permitted to name the relation between
this highest pleasure and its cause) is very great.
Those in whom it exists in excess are poets, in the
most universal sense of the word; and the pleasure
resulting from the manner in which they express
the influence of society or nature upon their own
minds, communicates itself to others, and gathers
a sort of reduplication from that community.
Their language is vitally metaphorical; that is,
it marks the before unapprehended relations of
things and perpetuates their apprehension, until
the words which represent them become, through
time, signs for portions or classes of thoughts
instead of pictures of integral thoughts; and then
if no new poets should arise to create afresh the
associations which have been thus disorganized,
language will be dead to all the nobler purposes of
human intercourse. These similitudes or relations
are finely said by Lord Bacon to be &#8216;the same
footsteps of nature impressed upon the various
subjects of the world&#8217;;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and he considers the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>faculty which perceives them as the storehouse of
axioms common to all knowledge. In the infancy
of society every author is necessarily a poet,
because language itself is poetry; and to be a poet
is to apprehend the true and the beautiful, in
a word, the good which exists in the relation,
subsisting, first between existence and perception,
and secondly between perception and expression.
Every original language near to its source is in
itself the chaos of a cyclic poem: the copiousness
of lexicography and the distinctions of grammar
are the works of a later age, and are merely the
catalogue and the form of the creations of poetry.</p>

<p>But poets, or those who imagine and express
this indestructible order, are not only the authors
of language and of music, of the dance, and architecture,
and statuary, and painting; they are the
institutors of laws, and the founders of civil society,
and the inventors of the arts of life, and the teachers
who draw into a certain propinquity with the
beautiful and the true, that partial apprehension
of the agencies of the invisible world which is called
religion. Hence all original religions are allegorical,
or susceptible of allegory, and, like Janus,
have a double face of false and true. Poets,
according to the circumstances of the age and
nation in which they appeared, were called, in the
earlier epochs of the world, legislators, or prophets:
a poet essentially comprises and unites both these
characters. For he not only beholds intensely
the present as it is, and discovers those laws
according to which present things ought to be
ordered, but he beholds the future in the present,
and his thoughts are the germs of the flower and
the fruit of latest time. Not that I assert poets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
to be prophets in the gross sense of the word, or
that they can foretell the form as surely as they
foreknow the spirit of events: such is the pretence
of superstition, which would make poetry an
attribute of prophecy, rather than prophecy an
attribute of poetry. A poet participates in the
eternal, the infinite, and the one; as far as relates
to his conceptions, time and place and number are
not. The grammatical forms which express the
moods of time, and the difference of persons, and
the distinction of place, are convertible with
respect to the highest poetry without injuring it
as poetry; and the choruses of Aeschylus, and the
book of <i>Job</i>, and Dante&#8217;s <i>Paradise</i>, would afford,
more than any other writings, examples of this
fact, if the limits of this essay did not forbid
citation. The creations of sculpture, painting,
and music, are illustrations still more decisive.</p>

<p>Language, colour, form, and religious and civil
habits of action, are all the instruments and materials
of poetry; they may be called poetry by
that figure of speech which considers the effect as
a synonym of the cause. But poetry in a more
restricted sense expresses those arrangements of
language, and especially metrical language, which
are created by that imperial faculty, whose throne
is curtained within the invisible nature of man.
And this springs from the nature itself of language,
which is a more direct representation of the actions
and passions of our internal being, and is susceptible
of more various and delicate combinations,
than colour, form, or motion, and is more plastic
and obedient to the control of that faculty of
which it is the creation. For language is arbitrarily
produced by the imagination, and has relation to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
thoughts alone; but all other materials, instruments,
and conditions of art, have relations among
each other, which limit and interpose between
conception and expression. The former is as a
mirror which reflects, the latter as a cloud which
enfeebles, the light of which both are mediums of
communication. Hence the fame of sculptors,
painters, and musicians, although the intrinsic
powers of the great masters of these arts may yield
in no degree to that of those who have employed
language as the hieroglyphic of their thoughts, has
never equalled that of poets in the restricted sense
of the term; as two performers of equal skill will
produce unequal effects from a guitar and a harp.
The fame of legislators and founders of religions, so
long as their institutions last, alone seems to exceed
that of poets in the restricted sense; but it can
scarcely be a question, whether, if we deduct the
celebrity which their flattery of the gross opinions
of the vulgar usually conciliates, together with that
which belonged to them in their higher character
of poets, any excess will remain.</p>

<p>We have thus circumscribed the word poetry
within the limits of that art which is the most
familiar and the most perfect expression of the
faculty itself. It is necessary, however, to make
the circle still narrower, and to determine the
distinction between measured and unmeasured
language; for the popular division into prose and
verse is inadmissible in accurate philosophy.</p>

<p>Sounds as well as thoughts have relation both
between each other and towards that which they
represent, and a perception of the order of those
relations has always been found connected with a
perception of the order of the relations of thoughts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Hence the language of poets has ever affected
a certain uniform and harmonious recurrence of
sound, without which it were not poetry, and
which is scarcely less indispensable to the communication
of its influence, than the words themselves,
without reference to that peculiar order.
Hence the vanity of translation; it were as wise
to cast a violet into a crucible that you might
discover the formal principle of its colour and
odour, as seek to transfuse from one language into
another the creations of a poet. The plant must
spring again from its seed, or it will bear no flower&mdash;and
this is the burthen of the curse of Babel.</p>

<p>An observation of the regular mode of the
recurrence of harmony in the language of poetical
minds, together with its relation to music, produced
metre, or a certain system of traditional forms of
harmony and language. Yet it is by no means
essential that a poet should accommodate his
language to this traditional form, so that the
harmony, which is its spirit, be observed. The
practice is indeed convenient and popular, and
to be preferred, especially in such composition as
includes much action: but every great poet must
inevitably innovate upon the example of his predecessors
in the exact structure of his peculiar
versification. The distinction between poets and
prose writers is a vulgar error. The distinction
between philosophers and poets has been anticipated.
Plato was essentially a poet&mdash;the truth
and splendour of his imagery, and the melody of his
language, are the most intense that it is possible to
conceive. He rejected the measure of the epic,
dramatic, and lyrical forms, because he sought to
kindle a harmony in thoughts divested of shape<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and action, and he forbore to invent any regular
plan of rhythm which would include, under determinate
forms, the varied pauses of his style.
Cicero sought to imitate the cadence of his periods,
but with little success. Lord Bacon was a poet.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
His language has a sweet and majestic rhythm,
which satisfies the sense, no less than the almost
superhuman wisdom of his philosophy satisfies the
intellect; it is a strain which distends, and then
bursts the circumference of the reader&#8217;s mind, and
pours itself forth together with it into the universal
element with which it has perpetual sympathy.
All the authors of revolutions in opinion are not
only necessarily poets as they are inventors, nor
even as their words unveil the permanent analogy
of things by images which participate in the life of
truth; but as their periods are harmonious and
rhythmical, and contain in themselves the elements
of verse; being the echo of the eternal music.
Nor are those supreme poets, who have employed
traditional forms of rhythm on account of the form
and action of their subjects, less capable of perceiving
and teaching the truth of things, than
those who have omitted that form. Shakespeare,
Dante, and Milton (to confine ourselves to modern
writers) are philosophers of the very loftiest power.</p>

<p>A poem is the very image of life expressed in its
eternal truth. There is this difference between
a story and a poem, that a story is a catalogue of
detached facts, which have no other connexion
than time, place, circumstance, cause and effect;
the other is the creation of actions according to the
unchangeable forms of human nature, as existing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>in the mind of the Creator, which is itself the image
of all other minds. The one is partial, and applies
only to a definite period of time, and a certain combination
of events which can never again recur;
the other is universal, and contains within itself
the germ of a relation to whatever motives or
actions have place in the possible varieties of human
nature. Time, which destroys the beauty and the
use of the story of particular facts, stripped of the
poetry which should invest them, augments that
of poetry, and for ever develops new and wonderful
applications of the eternal truth which it contains.
Hence epitomes have been called the moths of just
history; they eat out the poetry of it. A story
of particular facts is as a mirror which obscures
and distorts that which should be beautiful:
poetry is a mirror which makes beautiful that
which is distorted.</p>

<p>The parts of a composition may be poetical,
without the composition as a whole being a poem.
A single sentence may be considered as a whole,
though it may be found in the midst of a series of
unassimilated portions: a single word even may be
a spark of inextinguishable thought. And thus
all the great historians, Herodotus, Plutarch, Livy,
were poets; and although the plan of these writers,
especially that of Livy, restrained them from
developing this faculty in its highest degree, they
made copious and ample amends for their subjection,
by filling all the interstices of their subjects
with living images.</p>

<p>Having determined what is poetry, and who are
poets, let us proceed to estimate its effects upon
society.</p>

<p>Poetry is ever accompanied with pleasure: all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
spirits on which it falls open themselves to receive
the wisdom which is mingled with its delight. In
the infancy of the world, neither poets themselves
nor their auditors are fully aware of the excellence
of poetry: for it acts in a divine and unapprehended
manner, beyond and above consciousness; and it
is reserved for future generations to contemplate
and measure the mighty cause and effect in all the
strength and splendour of their union. Even in
modern times, no living poet ever arrived at the
fullness of his fame; the jury which sits in judgement
upon a poet, belonging as he does to all time,
must be composed of his peers: it must be impanelled
by Time from the selectest of the wise of
many generations. A poet is a nightingale, who
sits in darkness and sings to cheer its own solitude
with sweet sounds; his auditors are as men entranced
by the melody of an unseen musician, who
feel that they are moved and softened, yet know
not whence or why. The poems of Homer and his
contemporaries were the delight of infant Greece;
they were the elements of that social system which
is the column upon which all succeeding civilization
has reposed. Homer embodied the ideal perfection
of his age in human character; nor can we doubt
that those who read his verses were awakened to
an ambition of becoming like to Achilles, Hector,
and Ulysses: the truth and beauty of friendship,
patriotism, and persevering devotion to an object,
were unveiled to the depths in these immortal
creations: the sentiments of the auditors must
have been refined and enlarged by a sympathy with
such great and lovely impersonations, until from
admiring they imitated, and from imitation they
identified themselves with the objects of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
admiration. Nor let it be objected, that these
characters are remote from moral perfection, and
that they can by no means be considered as edifying
patterns for general imitation. Every epoch,
under names more or less specious, has deified its
peculiar errors; Revenge is the naked idol of the
worship of a semi-barbarous age; and Self-deceit
is the veiled image of unknown evil, before which
luxury and satiety lie prostrate. But a poet considers
the vices of his contemporaries as a temporary
dress in which his creations must be arrayed, and
which cover without concealing the eternal proportions
of their beauty. An epic or dramatic
personage is understood to wear them around his
soul, as he may the ancient armour or the modern
uniform around his body; whilst it is easy to conceive
a dress more graceful than either. The beauty
of the internal nature cannot be so far concealed
by its accidental vesture, but that the spirit of its
form shall communicate itself to the very disguise,
and indicate the shape it hides from the manner
in which it is worn. A majestic form and graceful
motions will express themselves through the most
barbarous and tasteless costume. Few poets of the
highest class have chosen to exhibit the beauty of
their conceptions in its naked truth and splendour;
and it is doubtful whether the alloy of costume,
habit, &amp;c., be not necessary to temper this planetary
music for mortal ears.</p>

<p>The whole objection, however, of the immorality
of poetry rests upon a misconception of the manner
in which poetry acts to produce the moral improvement
of man. Ethical science arranges the elements
which poetry has created, and propounds
schemes and proposes examples of civil and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
domestic life: nor is it for want of admirable
doctrines that men hate, and despise, and censure,
and deceive, and subjugate one another. But
poetry acts in another and diviner manner. It
awakens and enlarges the mind itself by rendering
it the receptacle of a thousand unapprehended
combinations of thought. Poetry lifts the veil
from the hidden beauty of the world, and makes
familiar objects be as if they were not familiar;
it reproduces all that it represents, and the impersonations
clothed in its Elysian light stand
thenceforward in the minds of those who have once
contemplated them, as memorials of that gentle
and exalted content which extends itself over all
thoughts and actions with which it coexists. The
great secret of morals is love; or a going out of
our own nature, and an identification of ourselves
with the beautiful which exists in thought, action,
or person, not our own. A man, to be greatly
good, must imagine intensely and comprehensively;
he must put himself in the place of another and of
many others; the pains and pleasures of his species
must become his own. The great instrument of
moral good is the imagination; and poetry administers
to the effect by acting upon the cause.
Poetry enlarges the circumference of the imagination
by replenishing it with thoughts of ever new
delight, which have the power of attracting and
assimilating to their own nature all other thoughts,
and which form new intervals and interstices whose
void for ever craves fresh food. Poetry strengthens
the faculty which is the organ of the moral nature
of man, in the same manner as exercise strengthens
a limb. A poet therefore would do ill to embody
his own conceptions of right and wrong, which are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
usually those of his place and time, in his poetical
creations, which participate in neither. By this
assumption of the inferior office of interpreting the
effect, in which perhaps after all he might acquit
himself but imperfectly, he would resign a glory
in a participation in the cause. There was little
danger that Homer, or any of the eternal poets,
should have so far misunderstood themselves as to
have abdicated this throne of their widest dominion.
Those in whom the poetical faculty, though great,
is less intense, as Euripides, Lucan, Tasso, Spenser,
have frequently affected a moral aim, and the
effect of their poetry is diminished in exact proportion
to the degree in which they compel us to
advert to this purpose.</p>

<p>Homer and the cyclic poets were followed at
a certain interval by the dramatic and lyrical poets
of Athens, who flourished contemporaneously with
all that is most perfect in the kindred expressions
of the poetical faculty; architecture, painting,
music, the dance, sculpture, philosophy, and, we
may add, the forms of civil life. For although the
scheme of Athenian society was deformed by many
imperfections which the poetry existing in chivalry
and Christianity has erased from the habits and
institutions of modern Europe; yet never at any
other period has so much energy, beauty, and virtue,
been developed; never was blind strength and
stubborn form so disciplined and rendered subject
to the will of man, or that will less repugnant to the
dictates of the beautiful and the true, as during
the century which preceded the death of Socrates.
Of no other epoch in the history of our species have
we records and fragments stamped so visibly with
the image of the divinity in man. But it is poetry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
alone, in form, in action, or in language, which has
rendered this epoch memorable above all others,
and the storehouse of examples to everlasting
time. For written poetry existed at that epoch
simultaneously with the other arts, and it is an
idle inquiry to demand which gave and which
received the light, which all, as from a common
focus, have scattered over the darkest periods of
succeeding time. We know no more of cause and
effect than a constant conjunction of events:
poetry is ever found to co-exist with whatever
other arts contribute to the happiness and perfection
of man. I appeal to what has already been
established to distinguish between the cause and
the effect.</p>

<p>It was at the period here adverted to, that the
drama had its birth; and however a succeeding
writer may have equalled or surpassed those few
great specimens of the Athenian drama which have
been preserved to us, it is indisputable that the
art itself never was understood or practised according
to the true philosophy of it, as at Athens. For
the Athenians employed language, action, music,
painting, the dance, and religious institutions, to
produce a common effect in the representation of
the highest idealisms of passion and of power;
each division in the art was made perfect in its kind
by artists of the most consummate skill, and was
disciplined into a beautiful proportion and unity
one towards the other. On the modern stage
a few only of the elements capable of expressing
the image of the poet&#8217;s conception are employed
at once. We have tragedy without music and
dancing; and music and dancing without the
highest impersonations of which they are the fit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
accompaniment, and both without religion and
solemnity. Religious institution has indeed been
usually banished from the stage. Our system of
divesting the actor&#8217;s face of a mask, on which the
many expressions appropriated to his dramatic
character might be moulded into one permanent
and unchanging expression, is favourable only to
a partial and inharmonious effect; it is fit for
nothing but a monologue, where all the attention
may be directed to some great master of ideal
mimicry. The modern practice of blending comedy
with tragedy, though liable to great abuse in point
of practice, is undoubtedly an extension of the
dramatic circle; but the comedy should be as in
<i>King Lear</i>, universal, ideal, and sublime. It is
perhaps the intervention of this principle which
determines the balance in favour of <i>King Lear</i>
against the <i>Oedipus Tyrannus</i> or the <i>Agamemnon</i>,
or, if you will, the trilogies with which they are
connected; unless the intense power of the choral
poetry, especially that of the latter, should be
considered as restoring the equilibrium. <i>King
Lear</i>, if it can sustain this comparison, may be
judged to be the most perfect specimen of the
dramatic art existing in the world; in spite of the
narrow conditions to which the poet was subjected
by the ignorance of the philosophy of the drama
which has prevailed in modern Europe. Calderon,
in his religious <i>Autos</i>, has attempted to fulfil some
of the high conditions of dramatic representation
neglected by Shakespeare; such as the establishing
a relation between the drama and religion,
and the accommodating them to music and
dancing; but he omits the observation of conditions
still more important, and more is lost than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
gained by the substitution of the rigidly-defined
and ever-repeated idealisms of a distorted superstition
for the living impersonations of the truth
of human passion.</p>

<p>But I digress.&mdash;The connexion of scenic exhibitions
with the improvement or corruption of
the manners of men, has been universally recognized:
in other words, the presence or absence of
poetry in its most perfect and universal form, has
been found to be connected with good and evil in
conduct or habit. The corruption which has been
imputed to the drama as an effect, begins, when
the poetry employed in its constitution ends:
I appeal to the history of manners whether the
periods of the growth of the one and the decline of
the other have not corresponded with an exactness
equal to any example of moral cause and effect.</p>

<p>The drama at Athens, or wheresoever else it may
have approached to its perfection, ever co-existed
with the moral and intellectual greatness of the
age. The tragedies of the Athenian poets are as
mirrors in which the spectator beholds himself,
under a thin disguise of circumstance, stript of all
but that ideal perfection and energy which every
one feels to be the internal type of all that he loves,
admires, and would become. The imagination is
enlarged by a sympathy with pains and passions
so mighty, that they distend in their conception the
capacity of that by which they are conceived; the
good affections are strengthened by pity, indignation,
terror, and sorrow; and an exalted calm is
prolonged from the satiety of this high exercise of
them into the tumult of familiar life: even crime
is disarmed of half its horror and all its contagion
by being represented as the fatal consequence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the unfathomable agencies of nature; error is thus
divested of its wilfulness; men can no longer
cherish it as the creation of their choice. In
a drama of the highest order there is little food for
censure or hatred; it teaches rather self-knowledge
and self-respect. Neither the eye nor the mind
can see itself, unless reflected upon that which it
resembles. The drama, so long as it continues to
express poetry, is as a prismatic and many-sided
mirror, which collects the brightest rays of human
nature and divides and reproduces them from the
simplicity of these elementary forms, and touches
them with majesty and beauty, and multiplies all
that it reflects, and endows it with the power of
propagating its like wherever it may fall.</p>

<p>But in periods of the decay of social life, the
drama sympathizes with that decay. Tragedy
becomes a cold imitation of the form of the great
masterpieces of antiquity, divested of all harmonious
accompaniment of the kindred arts; and
often the very form misunderstood, or a weak
attempt to teach certain doctrines, which the
writer considers as moral truths; and which are
usually no more than specious flatteries of some
gross vice or weakness, with which the author, in
common with his auditors, are infected. Hence
what has been called the classical and domestic
drama. Addison&#8217;s <i>Cato</i> is a specimen of the one;
and would it were not superfluous to cite examples
of the other! To such purposes poetry cannot be
made subservient. Poetry is a sword of lightning,
ever unsheathed, which consumes the scabbard
that would contain it. And thus we observe that
all dramatic writings of this nature are unimaginative
in a singular degree; they affect sentiment and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
passion, which, divested of imagination, are other
names for caprice and appetite. The period in our
own history of the grossest degradation of the
drama is the reign of Charles II, when all forms in
which poetry had been accustomed to be expressed
became hymns to the triumph of kingly power over
liberty and virtue. Milton stood alone illuminating
an age unworthy of him. At such periods the
calculating principle pervades all the forms of
dramatic exhibition, and poetry ceases to be expressed
upon them. Comedy loses its ideal
universality: wit succeeds to humour; we laugh
from self-complacency and triumph, instead of
pleasure; malignity, sarcasm, and contempt, succeed
to sympathetic merriment; we hardly laugh,
but we smile. Obscenity, which is ever blasphemy
against the divine beauty in life, becomes, from
the very veil which it assumes, more active if less
disgusting: it is a monster for which the corruption
of society for ever brings forth new food, which it
devours in secret.</p>

<p>The drama being that form under which a greater
number of modes of expression of poetry are susceptible
of being combined than any other, the
connexion of poetry and social good is more
observable in the drama than in whatever other
form. And it is indisputable that the highest
perfection of human society has ever corresponded
with the highest dramatic excellence; and that
the corruption or the extinction of the drama in
a nation where it has once flourished, is a mark of
a corruption of manners, and an extinction of the
energies which sustain the soul of social life. But,
as Machiavelli says of political institutions, that
life may be preserved and renewed, if men should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
arise capable of bringing back the drama to its
principles. And this is true with respect to poetry
in its most extended sense: all language, institution
and form, require not only to be produced but
to be sustained: the office and character of a poet
participates in the divine nature as regards providence,
no less than as regards creation.</p>

<p>Civil war, the spoils of Asia, and the fatal predominance
first of the Macedonian, and then of
the Roman arms, were so many symbols of the
extinction or suspension of the creative faculty in
Greece. The bucolic writers, who found patronage
under the lettered tyrants of Sicily and Egypt,
were the latest representatives of its most glorious
reign. Their poetry is intensely melodious; like
the odour of the tuberose, it overcomes and sickens
the spirit with excess of sweetness; whilst the
poetry of the preceding age was as a meadow-gale
of June, which mingles the fragrance of all the
flowers of the field, and adds a quickening and
harmonizing spirit of its own, which endows the
sense with a power of sustaining its extreme delight.
The bucolic and erotic delicacy in written poetry
is correlative with that softness in statuary, music,
and the kindred arts, and even in manners and
institutions, which distinguished the epoch to which
I now refer. Nor is it the poetical faculty itself,
or any misapplication of it, to which this want of
harmony is to be imputed. An equal sensibility to
the influence of the senses and the affections is to
be found in the writings of Homer and Sophocles:
the former, especially, has clothed sensual and
pathetic images with irresistible attractions.
Their superiority over these succeeding writers consists
in the presence of those thoughts which belong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
to the inner faculties of our nature, not in the
absence of those which are connected with the
external: their incomparable perfection consists
in a harmony of the union of all. It is not what
the erotic poets have, but what they have not, in
which their imperfection consists. It is not inasmuch
as they were poets, but inasmuch as they
were not poets, that they can be considered with
any plausibility as connected with the corruption
of their age. Had that corruption availed so as
to extinguish in them the sensibility to pleasure,
passion, and natural scenery, which is imputed to
them as an imperfection, the last triumph of evil
would have been achieved. For the end of social
corruption is to destroy all sensibility to pleasure;
and, therefore, it is corruption. It begins at the
imagination and the intellect as at the core, and
distributes itself thence as a paralysing venom,
through the affections into the very appetites,
until all become a torpid mass in which hardly
sense survives. At the approach of such a period,
poetry ever addresses itself to those faculties which
are the last to be destroyed, and its voice is heard,
like the footsteps of Astraea, departing from the
world. Poetry ever communicates all the pleasure
which men are capable of receiving: it is ever still
the light of life; the source of whatever of beautiful
or generous or true can have place in an evil time.
It will readily be confessed that those among the
luxurious citizens of Syracuse and Alexandria, who
were delighted with the poems of Theocritus, were
less cold, cruel, and sensual than the remnant of
their tribe. But corruption must utterly have
destroyed the fabric of human society before poetry
can ever cease. The sacred links of that chain have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
never been entirely disjoined, which descending
through the minds of many men is attached to
those great minds, whence as from a magnet the
invisible effluence is sent forth, which at once
connects, animates, and sustains the life of all. It
is the faculty which contains within itself the seeds
at once of its own and of social renovation. And
let us not circumscribe the effects of the bucolic
and erotic poetry within the limits of the sensibility
of those to whom it was addressed. They may
have perceived the beauty of those immortal compositions,
simply as fragments and isolated portions:
those who are more finely organized, or born in
a happier age, may recognize them as episodes to
that great poem, which all poets, like the co-operating
thoughts of one great mind, have built
up since the beginning of the world.</p>

<p>The same revolutions within a narrower sphere
had place in ancient Rome; but the actions and
forms of its social life never seem to have been
perfectly saturated with the poetical element. The
Romans appear to have considered the Greeks as
the selectest treasuries of the selectest forms of
manners and of nature, and to have abstained from
creating in measured language, sculpture, music, or
architecture, anything which might bear a particular
relation to their own condition, whilst it
should bear a general one to the universal constitution
of the world. But we judge from partial
evidence, and we judge perhaps partially. Ennius,
Varro, Pacuvius, and Accius, all great poets, have
been lost. Lucretius is in the highest, and Virgil
in a very high sense, a creator. The chosen
delicacy of expressions of the latter, are as a mist
of light which conceal from us the intense and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
exceeding truth of his conceptions of nature.
Livy is instinct with poetry. Yet Horace, Catullus,
Ovid, and generally the other great writers of the
Virgilian age, saw man and nature in the mirror
of Greece. The institutions also, and the religion
of Rome were less poetical than those of Greece,
as the shadow is less vivid than the substance.
Hence poetry in Rome seemed to follow, rather
than accompany, the perfection of political and
domestic society. The true poetry of Rome lived
in its institutions; for whatever of beautiful, true,
and majestic, they contained, could have sprung
only from the faculty which creates the order in
which they consist. The life of Camillus, the
death of Regulus; the expectation of the senators,
in their godlike state, of the victorious Gauls:
the refusal of the republic to make peace with
Hannibal, after the battle of Cannae, were not the
consequences of a refined calculation of the probable
personal advantage to result from such a rhythm
and order in the shows of life, to those who were at
once the poets and the actors of these immortal
dramas. The imagination beholding the beauty of
this order, created it out of itself according to its
own idea; the consequence was empire, and the
reward everliving fame. These things are not the
less poetry <i>quia carent vate sacro</i>. They are the
episodes of that cyclic poem written by Time upon
the memories of men. The Past, like an inspired
rhapsodist, fills the theatre of everlasting generations
with their harmony.</p>

<p>At length the ancient system of religion and
manners had fulfilled the circle of its revolutions.
And the world would have fallen into utter anarchy
and darkness, but that, there were found poets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
among the authors of the Christian and chivalric
systems of manners and religion, who created
forms of opinion and action never before conceived;
which, copied into the imaginations of men,
become as generals to the bewildered armies of
their thoughts. It is foreign to the present purpose
to touch upon the evil produced by these systems:
except that we protest, on the ground of the
principles already established, that no portion of it
can be attributed to the poetry they contain.</p>

<p>It is probable that the poetry of Moses, Job,
David, Solomon, and Isaiah, had produced a great
effect upon the mind of Jesus and his disciples.
The scattered fragments preserved to us by the
biographers of this extraordinary person, are all
instinct with the most vivid poetry. But his
doctrines seem to have been quickly distorted. At
a certain period after the prevalence of a system of
opinions founded upon those promulgated by him,
the three forms into which Plato had distributed
the faculties of mind underwent a sort of apotheosis,
and became the object of the worship of the civilized
world. Here it is to be confessed that &#8216;Light
seems to thicken&#8217;, and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The crow makes wing to the rooky wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And night&#8217;s black agents to their preys do rouse.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">But mark how beautiful an order has sprung from
the dust and blood of this fierce chaos! how the
world, as from a resurrection, balancing itself on
the golden wings of knowledge and of hope, has
reassumed its yet unwearied flight into the heaven
of time. Listen to the music, unheard by outward
ears, which is as a ceaseless and invisible wind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
nourishing its everlasting course with strength and
swiftness.</p>

<p>The poetry in the doctrines of Jesus Christ, and
the mythology and institutions of the Celtic
conquerors of the Roman empire, outlived the
darkness and the convulsions connected with their
growth and victory, and blended themselves in
a new fabric of manners and opinion. It is an
error to impute the ignorance of the dark ages to
the Christian doctrines or the predominance of
the Celtic nations. Whatever of evil their agencies
may have contained sprang from the extinction
of the poetical principle, connected with the
progress of despotism and superstition. Men,
from causes too intricate to be here discussed,
had become insensible and selfish: their own will
had become feeble, and yet they were its slaves,
and thence the slaves of the will of others; lust,
fear, avarice, cruelty, and fraud, characterized
a race amongst whom no one was to be found
capable of <i>creating</i> in form, language, or institution.
The moral anomalies of such a state of society are
not justly to be charged upon any class of events
immediately connected with them, and those
events are most entitled to our approbation which
could dissolve it most expeditiously. It is unfortunate
for those who cannot distinguish words
from thoughts, that many of these anomalies have
been incorporated into our popular religion.</p>

<p>It was not until the eleventh century that the
effects of the poetry of the Christian and chivalric
systems began to manifest themselves. The
principle of equality had been discovered and
applied by Plato in his <i>Republic</i>, as the theoretical
rule of the mode in which the materials of pleasure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and of power, produced by the common skill and
labour of human beings, ought to be distributed
among them. The limitations of this rule were
asserted by him to be determined only by the
sensibility of each, or the utility to result to all.
Plato, following the doctrines of Timaeus and
Pythagoras, taught also a moral and intellectual
system of doctrine, comprehending at once the
past, the present, and the future condition of man.
Jesus Christ divulged the sacred and eternal truths
contained in these views to mankind, and Christianity,
in its abstract purity, became the exoteric
expression of the esoteric doctrines of the poetry
and wisdom of antiquity. The incorporation of
the Celtic nations with the exhausted population
of the south, impressed upon it the figure of the
poetry existing in their mythology and institutions.
The result was a sum of the action and reaction of
all the causes included in it; for it may be assumed
as a maxim that no nation or religion can supersede
any other without incorporating into itself a portion
of that which it supersedes. The abolition
of personal and domestic slavery, and the emancipation
of women from a great part of the degrading
restraints of antiquity, were among the
consequences of these events.</p>

<p>The abolition of personal slavery is the basis of
the highest political hope that it can enter into
the mind of man to conceive. The freedom of
women produced the poetry of sexual love. Love
became a religion, the idols of whose worship were
ever present. It was as if the statues of Apollo
and the Muses had been endowed with life and
motion, and had walked forth among their
worshippers; so that earth became peopled by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the inhabitants of a diviner world. The familiar
appearance and proceedings of life became wonderful
and heavenly, and a paradise was created as
out of the wrecks of Eden. And as this creation
itself is poetry, so its creators were poets; and
language was the instrument of their art: &#8216;Galeotto
f&ugrave; il libro, e chi lo scrisse.&#8217; The Proven&ccedil;al Trouveurs,
or inventors, preceded Petrarch, whose verses are as
spells, which unseal the inmost enchanted fountains
of the delight which is in the grief of love. It is
impossible to feel them without becoming a portion
of that beauty which we contemplate: it were
superfluous to explain how the gentleness and the
elevation of mind connected with these sacred
emotions can render men more amiable, more
generous and wise, and lift them out of the dull
vapours of the little world of self. Dante understood
the secret things of love even more than
Petrarch. His <i>Vita Nuova</i> is an inexhaustible
fountain of purity of sentiment and language: it
is the idealized history of that period, and those
intervals of his life which were dedicated to love.
His apotheosis of Beatrice in Paradise, and the
gradations of his own love and her loveliness, by
which as by steps he feigns himself to have
ascended to the throne of the Supreme Cause, is
the most glorious imagination of modern poetry.
The acutest critics have justly reversed the judgement
of the vulgar, and the order of the great
acts of the &#8216;Divine Drama&#8217;, in the measure of
the admiration which they accord to the Hell,
Purgatory, and Paradise. The latter is a perpetual
hymn of everlasting love. Love, which found
a worthy poet in Plato alone of all the ancients,
has been celebrated by a chorus of the greatest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
writers of the renovated world; and the music
has penetrated the caverns of society, and its
echoes still drown the dissonance of arms and
superstition. At successive intervals, Ariosto,
Tasso, Shakespeare, Spenser, Calderon, Rousseau,
and the great writers of our own age, have celebrated
the dominion of love, planting as it were trophies
in the human mind of that sublimest victory over
sensuality and force. The true relation borne to
each other by the sexes into which human kind is
distributed, has become less misunderstood; and
if the error which confounded diversity with
inequality of the powers of the two sexes has been
partially recognized in the opinions and institutions
of modern Europe, we owe this great benefit to the
worship of which chivalry was the law, and poets
the prophets.</p>

<p>The poetry of Dante may be considered as the
bridge thrown over the stream of time, which
unites the modern and ancient world. The
distorted notions of invisible things which Dante
and his rival Milton have idealized, are merely the
mask and the mantle in which these great poets
walk through eternity enveloped and disguised.
It is a difficult question to determine how far
they were conscious of the distinction which must
have subsisted in their minds between their own
creeds and that of the people. Dante at least
appears to wish to mark the full extent of it by
placing Riphaeus, whom Virgil calls <i>iustissimus
unus</i>, in Paradise, and observing a most heretical
caprice in his distribution of rewards and punishments.
And Milton&#8217;s poem contains within itself
a philosophical refutation of that system, of which,
by a strange and natural antithesis, it has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
a chief popular support. Nothing can exceed the
energy and magnificence of the character of Satan
as expressed in <i>Paradise Lost</i>. It is a mistake to
suppose that he could ever have been intended
for the popular personification of evil. Implacable
hate, patient cunning, and a sleepless refinement
of device to inflict the extremest anguish on an
enemy, these things are evil; and, although
venial in a slave, are not to be forgiven in a tyrant;
although redeemed by much that ennobles his
defeat in one subdued, are marked by all that
dishonours his conquest in the victor. Milton&#8217;s
Devil as a moral being is as far superior to his
God, as one who perseveres in some purpose which
he has conceived to be excellent in spite of
adversity and torture, is to one who in the cold
security of undoubted triumph inflicts the most
horrible revenge upon his enemy, not from any
mistaken notion of inducing him to repent of
a perseverance in enmity, but with the alleged
design of exasperating him to deserve new torments.
Milton has so far violated the popular creed (if
this shall be judged to be a violation) as to have
alleged no superiority of moral virtue to his God
over his Devil. And this bold neglect of a direct
moral purpose is the most decisive proof of the
supremacy of Milton&#8217;s genius. He mingled as it
were the elements of human nature as colours
upon a single pallet, and arranged them in the
composition of his great picture according to the
laws of epic truth; that is, according to the laws
of that principle by which a series of actions of
the external universe and of intelligent and ethical
beings is calculated to excite the sympathy of
succeeding generations of mankind. The <i>Divina<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Commedia</i> and <i>Paradise Lost</i> have conferred upon
modern mythology a systematic form; and when
change and time shall have added one more
superstition to the mass of those which have
arisen and decayed upon the earth, commentators
will be learnedly employed in elucidating the
religion of ancestral Europe, only not utterly
forgotten because it will have been stamped with
the eternity of genius.</p>

<p>Homer was the first and Dante the second epic
poet: that is, the second poet, the series of whose
creations bore a defined and intelligible relation
to the knowledge and sentiment and religion of
the age in which he lived, and of the ages which
followed it: developing itself in correspondence
with their development. For Lucretius had limed
the wings of his swift spirit in the dregs of the
sensible world; and Virgil, with a modesty that ill
became his genius, had affected the fame of an
imitator, even whilst he created anew all that
he copied; and none among the flock of mock-birds,
though their notes were sweet, Apollonius
Rhodius, Quintus Calaber, Nonnus, Lucan, Statius,
or Claudian, have sought even to fulfil a single
condition of epic truth. Milton was the third epic
poet. For if the title of epic in its highest sense
be refused to the <i>Aeneid</i>, still less can it be conceded
to the <i>Orlando Furioso</i>, the <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i>,
the <i>Lusiad</i>, or the <i>Faerie Queene</i>.</p>

<p>Dante and Milton were both deeply penetrated
with the ancient religion of the civilized world;
and its spirit exists in their poetry probably in the
same proportion as its forms survived in the
unreformed worship of modern Europe. The one
preceded and the other followed the Reformation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
at almost equal intervals. Dante was the first
religious reformer, and Luther surpassed him
rather in the rudeness and acrimony, than in the
boldness of his censures of papal usurpation.
Dante was the first awakener of entranced Europe;
he created a language, in itself music and persuasion,
out of a chaos of inharmonious barbarisms. He
was the congregator of those great spirits who
presided over the resurrection of learning; the
Lucifer of that starry flock which in the thirteenth
century shone forth from republican Italy, as from
a heaven, into the darkness of the benighted world.
His very words are instinct with spirit; each is
as a spark, a burning atom of inextinguishable
thought; and many yet lie covered in the ashes
of their birth, and pregnant with a lightning
which has yet found no conductor. All high
poetry is infinite; it is as the first acorn, which
contained all oaks potentially. Veil after veil may
be undrawn, and the inmost naked beauty of the
meaning never exposed. A great poem is a fountain
for ever overflowing with the waters of wisdom and
delight; and after one person and one age has
exhausted all its divine effluence which their
peculiar relations enable them to share, another
and yet another succeeds, and new relations are
ever developed, the source of an unforeseen and
an unconceived delight.</p>

<p>The age immediately succeeding to that of
Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio, was characterized
by a revival of painting, sculpture, and architecture.
Chaucer caught the sacred inspiration, and the
superstructure of English literature is based upon
the materials of Italian invention.</p>

<p>But let us not be betrayed from a defence into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
a critical history of poetry and its influence on
society. Be it enough to have pointed out the
effects of poets, in the large and true sense of the
word, upon their own and all succeeding times.</p>

<p>But poets have been challenged to resign the
civic crown to reasoners and mechanists, on
another plea. It is admitted that the exercise of
the imagination is most delightful, but it is alleged
that that of reason is more useful. Let us examine
as the grounds of this distinction, what is here
meant by utility. Pleasure or good, in a general
sense, is that which the consciousness of a sensitive
and intelligent being seeks, and in which, when
found, it acquiesces. There are two kinds of
pleasure, one durable, universal and permanent;
the other transitory and particular. Utility may
either express the means of producing the former
or the latter. In the former sense, whatever
strengthens and purifies the affections, enlarges
the imagination, and adds spirit to sense, is useful.
But a narrower meaning may be assigned to the
word utility, confining it to express that which
banishes the importunity of the wants of our
animal nature, the surrounding men with security
of life, the dispersing the grosser delusions of
superstition, and the conciliating such a degree of
mutual forbearance among men as may consist
with the motives of personal advantage.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the promoters of utility, in this
limited sense, have their appointed office in society.
They follow the footsteps of poets, and copy the
sketches of their creations into the book of common
life. They make space, and give time. Their
exertions are of the highest value, so long as they
confine their administration of the concerns of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
inferior powers of our nature within the limits due
to the superior ones. But whilst the sceptic
destroys gross superstitions, let him spare to
deface, as some of the French writers have defaced,
the eternal truths charactered upon the imaginations
of men. Whilst the mechanist abridges, and
the political economist combines labour, let them
beware that their speculations, for want of
correspondence with those first principles which
belong to the imagination, do not tend, as they
have in modern England, to exasperate at once
the extremes of luxury and want. They have
exemplified the saying, &#8216;To him that hath, more
shall be given; and from him that hath not, the
little that he hath shall be taken away.&#8217; The rich
have become richer, and the poor have become
poorer; and the vessel of the state is driven
between the Scylla and Charybdis of anarchy and
despotism. Such are the effects which must ever
flow from an unmitigated exercise of the calculating
faculty.</p>

<p>It is difficult to define pleasure in its highest
sense; the definition involving a number of
apparent paradoxes. For, from an inexplicable
defect of harmony in the constitution of human
nature, the pain of the inferior is frequently
connected with the pleasures of the superior
portions of our being. Sorrow, terror, anguish,
despair itself, are often the chosen expressions of
an approximation to the highest good. Our
sympathy in tragic fiction depends on this principle;
tragedy delights by affording a shadow of the
pleasure which exists in pain. This is the source
also of the melancholy which is inseparable from
the sweetest melody. The pleasure that is in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
sorrow is sweeter than the pleasure of pleasure
itself. And hence the saying, &#8216;It is better to go
to the house of mourning, than to the house of
mirth.&#8217; Nor that this highest species of pleasure
is necessarily linked with pain. The delight of
love and friendship, the ecstasy of the admiration
of nature, the joy of the perception and still
more of the creation of poetry, is often wholly
unalloyed.</p>

<p>The production and assurance of pleasure in
this highest sense is true utility. Those who
produce and preserve this pleasure are poets or
poetical philosophers.</p>

<p>The exertions of Locke, Hume, Gibbon, Voltaire,
Rousseau,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and their disciples, in favour of
oppressed and deluded humanity, are entitled
to the gratitude of mankind. Yet it is easy to
calculate the degree of moral and intellectual
improvement which the world would have
exhibited, had they never lived. A little more
nonsense would have been talked for a century
or two; and perhaps a few more men, women,
and children, burnt as heretics. We might not at
this moment have been congratulating each other
on the abolition of the Inquisition in Spain.
But it exceeds all imagination to conceive what
would have been the moral condition of the world
if neither Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Chaucer,
Shakespeare, Calderon, Lord Bacon, nor Milton,
had ever existed; if Raphael and Michael Angelo
had never been born; if the Hebrew poetry had
never been translated; if a revival of the study
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>of Greek literature had never taken place; if no
monuments of ancient sculpture had been handed
down to us; and if the poetry of the religion of
the ancient world had been extinguished together
with its belief. The human mind could never,
except by the intervention of these excitements,
have been awakened to the invention of the
grosser sciences, and that application of analytical
reasoning to the aberrations of society, which it is
now attempted to exalt over the direct expression
of the inventive and creative faculty itself.</p>

<p>We have more moral, political and historical
wisdom, than we know how to reduce into practice;
we have more scientific and economical knowledge
than can be accommodated to the just distribution
of the produce which it multiplies. The poetry in
these systems of thought, is concealed by the
accumulation of facts and calculating processes.
There is no want of knowledge respecting what is
wisest and best in morals, government, and political
economy, or at least, what is wiser and better than
what men now practise and endure. But we let
&#8216;<i>I dare not</i> wait upon <i>I would</i>, like the poor cat
in the adage.&#8217; We want the creative faculty to
imagine that which we know; we want the
generous impulse to act that which we imagine;
we want the poetry of life: our calculations have
outrun conception; we have eaten more than we
can digest. The cultivation of those sciences
which have enlarged the limits of the empire of
man over the external world, has, for want of the
poetical faculty, proportionally circumscribed those
of the internal world; and man, having enslaved
the elements, remains himself a slave. To what
but a cultivation of the mechanical arts in a degree<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
disproportioned to the presence of the creative
faculty, which is the basis of all knowledge, is to
be attributed the abuse of all invention for abridging
and combining labour, to the exasperation of the
inequality of mankind? From what other cause
has it arisen that the discoveries which should have
lightened, have added a weight to the curse
imposed on Adam? Poetry, and the principle
of Self, of which money is the visible incarnation,
are the God and Mammon of the world.</p>

<p>The functions of the poetical faculty are twofold;
by one it creates new materials of knowledge
and power and pleasure; by the other it engenders
in the mind a desire to reproduce and arrange
them according to a certain rhythm and order
which may be called the beautiful and the good.
The cultivation of poetry is never more to be
desired than at periods when, from an excess of
the selfish and calculating principle, the accumulation
of the materials of external life exceed the
quantity of the power of assimilating them to
the internal laws of human nature. The body
has then become too unwieldy for that which
animates it.</p>

<p>Poetry is indeed something divine. It is at once
the centre and circumference of knowledge; it is
that which comprehends all science, and that to
which all science must be referred. It is at the
same time the root and blossom of all other systems
of thought; it is that from which all spring, and
that which adorns all; and that which, if blighted,
denies the fruit and the seed, and withholds from
the barren world the nourishment and the succession
of the scions of the tree of life. It is the perfect
and consummate surface and bloom of all things;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
it is as the odour and the colour of the rose to the
texture of the elements which compose it, as the
form and splendour of unfaded beauty to the
secrets of anatomy and corruption. What were
virtue, love, patriotism, friendship&mdash;what were the
scenery of this beautiful universe which we inhabit;
what were our consolations on this side of the
grave&mdash;and what were our aspirations beyond it,
if poetry did not ascend to bring light and fire
from those eternal regions where the owl-winged
faculty of calculation dare not ever soar? Poetry
is not like reasoning, a power to be exerted
according to the determination of the will. A man
cannot say, &#8216;I will compose poetry.&#8217; The greatest
poet even cannot say it; for the mind in creation
is as a fading coal, which some invisible influence,
like an inconstant wind, awakens to transitory
brightness; this power arises from within, like
the colour of a flower which fades and changes as
it is developed, and the conscious portions of our
natures are unprophetic either of its approach or
its departure. Could this influence be durable in
its original purity and force, it is impossible to
predict the greatness of the results; but when
composition begins, inspiration is already on the
decline, and the most glorious poetry that has
ever been communicated to the world is probably
a feeble shadow of the original conceptions of the
poet. I appeal to the greatest poets of the present
day, whether it is not an error to assert that the
finest passages of poetry are produced by labour
and study. The toil and the delay recommended
by critics can be justly interpreted to mean no
more than a careful observation of the inspired
moments, and an artificial connexion of the spaces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
between their suggestions by the intertexture of
conventional expressions; a necessity only imposed
by the limitedness of the poetical faculty itself;
for Milton conceived the <i>Paradise Lost</i> as a whole
before he executed it in portions. We have his
own authority also for the muse having &#8216;dictated&#8217;
to him the &#8216;unpremeditated song&#8217;. And let this
be an answer to those who would allege the fifty-six
various readings of the first line of the <i>Orlando
Furioso</i>. Compositions so produced are to poetry
what mosaic is to painting. This instinct and
intuition of the poetical faculty is still more
observable in the plastic and pictorial arts; a great
statue or picture grows under the power of the
artist as a child in the mother&#8217;s womb; and the
very mind which directs the hands in formation
is incapable of accounting to itself for the origin,
the gradations, or the media of the process.</p>

<p>Poetry is the record of the best and happiest
moments of the happiest and best minds. We are
aware of evanescent visitations of thought and
feeling sometimes associated with place or person,
sometimes regarding our own mind alone, and
always arising unforeseen and departing unbidden,
but elevating and delightful beyond all expression:
so that even in the desire and regret they leave,
there cannot but be pleasure, participating as it
does in the nature of its object. It is as it were the
interpenetration of a diviner nature through our
own; but its footsteps are like those of a wind
over the sea, which the coming calm erases, and
whose traces remain only, as on the wrinkled sand
which paves it. These and corresponding conditions
of being are experienced principally by those of
the most delicate sensibility and the most enlarged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
imagination; and the state of mind produced by
them is at war with every base desire. The enthusiasm
of virtue, love, patriotism, and friendship, is
essentially linked with such emotions; and whilst
they last, self appears as what it is, an atom to a
universe. Poets are not only subject to these experiences
as spirits of the most refined organization,
but they can colour all that they combine with the
evanescent hues of this ethereal world; a word, a
trait in the representation of a scene or a passion,
will touch the enchanted chord, and reanimate, in
those who have ever experienced these emotions, the
sleeping, the cold, the buried image of the past.
Poetry thus makes immortal all that is best and
most beautiful in the world; it arrests the vanishing
apparitions which haunt the interlunations of life,
and veiling them, or in language or in form, sends
them forth among mankind, bearing sweet news of
kindred joy to those with whom their sisters abide&mdash;abide,
because there is no portal of expression from
the caverns of the spirit which they inhabit into
the universe of things. Poetry redeems from decay
the visitations of the divinity in man.</p>

<p>Poetry turns all things to loveliness; it exalts
the beauty of that which is most beautiful, and it
adds beauty to that which is most deformed; it
marries exultation and horror, grief and pleasure,
eternity and change; it subdues to union under its
light yoke all irreconcilable things. It transmutes
all that it touches, and every form moving within
the radiance of its presence is changed by wondrous
sympathy to an incarnation of the spirit which it
breathes: its secret alchemy turns to potable gold
the poisonous waters which flow from death
through life; it strips the veil of familiarity from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the world, and lays bare the naked and sleeping
beauty, which is the spirit of its forms.</p>

<p>All things exist as they are perceived; at least
in relation to the percipient. &#8216;The mind is its
own place, and of itself can make a heaven of hell,
a hell of heaven.&#8217; But poetry defeats the curse
which binds us to be subjected to the accident of
surrounding impressions. And whether it spreads
its own figured curtain, or withdraws life&#8217;s dark
veil from before the scene of things, it equally
creates for us a being within our being. It makes
us the inhabitants of a world to which the familiar
world is a chaos. It reproduces the common
universe of which we are portions and percipients,
and it purges from our inward sight the film of
familiarity which obscures from us the wonder of our
being. It compels us to feel that which we perceive,
and to imagine that which we know. It creates
anew the universe, after it has been annihilated in
our minds by the recurrence of impressions blunted
by reiteration. It justifies the bold and true words
of Tasso: <i>Non merita nome di creatore, se non Iddio
ed il Poeta</i>.</p>

<p>A poet, as he is the author to others of the
highest wisdom, pleasure, virtue and glory, so he
ought personally to be the happiest, the best, the
wisest, and the most illustrious of men. As to his
glory, let time be challenged to declare whether
the fame of any other institutor of human life be
comparable to that of a poet. That he is the wisest,
the happiest, and the best, inasmuch as he is a poet,
is equally incontrovertible: the greatest poets
have been men of the most spotless virtue, of the
most consummate prudence, and, if we would look
into the interior of their lives, the most fortunate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of men: and the exceptions, as they regard those
who possessed the poetic faculty in a high yet
inferior degree, will be found on consideration to
confine rather than destroy the rule. Let us for
a moment stoop to the arbitration of popular
breath, and usurping and uniting in our own
persons the incompatible characters of accuser,
witness, judge, and executioner, let us decide
without trial, testimony, or form, that certain
motives of those who are &#8216;there sitting where we
dare not soar&#8217;, are reprehensible. Let us assume
that Homer was a drunkard, that Virgil was
a flatterer, that Horace was a coward, that Tasso
was a madman, that Lord Bacon was a peculator,
that Raphael was a libertine, that Spenser was
a poet laureate. It is inconsistent with this
division of our subject to cite living poets, but
posterity has done ample justice to the great
names now referred to. Their errors have been
weighed and found to have been dust in the
balance; if their sins &#8216;were as scarlet, they are
now white as snow&#8217;: they have been washed in
the blood of the mediator and redeemer, Time.
Observe in what a ludicrous chaos the imputations
of real or fictitious crime have been confused in
the contemporary calumnies against poetry and
poets; consider how little is, as it appears&mdash;or
appears, as it is; look to your own motives, and
judge not, lest ye be judged.</p>

<p>Poetry, as has been said, differs in this respect
from logic, that it is not subject to the control of
the active powers of the mind, and that its birth
and recurrence have no necessary connexion with
the consciousness or will. It is presumptuous to
determine that these are the necessary conditions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of all mental causation, when mental effects are
experienced unsusceptible of being referred to
them. The frequent recurrence of the poetical
power, it is obvious to suppose, may produce in
the mind a habit of order and harmony correlative
with its own nature and with its effects upon other
minds. But in the intervals of inspiration, and
they may be frequent without being durable,
a poet becomes a man, and is abandoned to the
sudden reflux of the influences under which others
habitually live. But as he is more delicately
organized than other men, and sensible to pain
and pleasure, both his own and that of others, in
a degree unknown to them, he will avoid the one
and pursue the other with an ardour proportioned
to this difference. And he renders himself obnoxious
to calumny, when he neglects to observe
the circumstances under which these objects of
universal pursuit and flight have disguised themselves
in one another&#8217;s garments.</p>

<p>But there is nothing necessarily evil in this error,
and thus cruelty, envy, revenge, avarice, and the
passions purely evil, have never formed any portion
of the popular imputations on the lives of poets.</p>

<p>I have thought it most favourable to the cause
of truth to set down these remarks according to
the order in which they were suggested to my
mind, by a consideration of the subject itself,
instead of observing the formality of a polemical
reply; but if the view which they contain be just,
they will be found to involve a refutation of the
arguers against poetry, so far at least as regards
the first division of the subject. I can readily
conjecture what should have moved the gall of
some learned and intelligent writers who quarrel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
with certain versifiers; I confess myself, like them,
unwilling to be stunned by the Theseids of the
hoarse Codri of the day. Bavius and Maevius
undoubtedly are, as they ever were, insufferable
persons. But it belongs to a philosophical critic
to distinguish rather than confound.</p>

<p>The first part of these remarks has related to
poetry in its elements and principles; and it has
been shown, as well as the narrow limits assigned
them would permit, that what is called poetry, in
a restricted sense, has a common source with all
other forms of order and of beauty, according to
which the materials of human life are susceptible of
being arranged, and which is poetry in a universal
sense.</p>

<p>The second part<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> will have for its object an
application of these principles to the present state
of the cultivation of poetry, and a defence of the
attempt to idealize the modern forms of manners
and opinions, and compel them into a subordination
to the imaginative and creative faculty. For the
literature of England, an energetic development
of which has ever preceded or accompanied
a great and free development of the national
will, has arisen as it were from a new birth. In
spite of the low-thoughted envy which would
undervalue contemporary merit, our own will be
a memorable age in intellectual achievements,
and we live among such philosophers and poets as
surpass beyond comparison any who have appeared
since the last national struggle for civil and
religious liberty. The most unfailing herald,
companion, and follower of the awakening of
a great people to work a beneficial change in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>opinion or institution, is poetry. At such periods
there is an accumulation of the power of communicating
and receiving intense and impassioned
conceptions respecting man and nature. The
persons in whom this power resides may often, as
far as regards many portions of their nature, have
little apparent correspondence with that spirit of
good of which they are the ministers. But even
whilst they deny and abjure, they are yet compelled
to serve, the power which is seated on the throne
of their own soul. It is impossible to read the
compositions of the most celebrated writers of
the present day without being startled with the
electric life which burns within their words. They
measure the circumference and sound the depths
of human nature with a comprehensive and all-penetrating
spirit, and they are themselves perhaps
the most sincerely astonished at its manifestations;
for it is less their spirit than the spirit of the age.
Poets are the hierophants of an unapprehended
inspiration; the mirrors of the gigantic shadows
which futurity casts upon the present; the words
which express what they understand not; the
trumpets which sing to battle, and feel not what
they inspire; the influence which is moved not,
but moves. Poets are the unacknowledged
legislators of the world.</p>

<h3>1778-1830</h3>

<h3>MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823)</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">My</span> father was a Dissenting Minister at Wem in
Shropshire; and in the year 1798 (the figures that
compose the date are to me like the &#8216;dreaded name
of Demogorgon&#8217;) Mr. Coleridge came to Shrewsbury,
to succeed Mr. Rowe in the spiritual charge of
a Unitarian congregation there. He did not come
till late on the Saturday afternoon before he was to
preach; and Mr. Rowe, who himself went down to
the coach in a state of anxiety and expectation to
look for the arrival of his successor, could find no
one at all answering the description but a round-faced
man in a short black coat (like a shooting-jacket)
which hardly seemed to have been made for
him, but who seemed to be talking at a great rate
to his fellow-passengers. Mr. Rowe had scarce
returned to give an account of his disappointment,
when the round-faced man in black entered, and
dissipated all doubts on the subject, by beginning
to talk. He did not cease while he stayed; nor
has he since, that I know of. He held the good
town of Shrewsbury in delightful suspense for
three weeks that he remained there, &#8216;fluttering the
<i>proud Salopians</i> like an eagle in a dove-cote&#8217;;
and the Welsh mountains that skirt the horizon
with their tempestuous confusion, agree to have
heard no such mystic sounds since the days of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">High-born Hoel&#8217;s harp or soft Llewelyn&#8217;s lay!<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></div></div>

<p class="noin">As we passed along between Wem and Shrewsbury,
and I eyed their blue tops seen through the wintry
branches, or the red rustling leaves of the sturdy
oak-trees by the road-side, a sound was in my ears
as of a Siren&#8217;s song; I was stunned, startled with it,
as from deep sleep; but I had no notion then that
I should ever be able to express my admiration to
others in motley imagery or quaint allusion, till the
light of his genius shone into my soul, like the sun&#8217;s
rays glittering in the puddles of the road. I was at
that time dumb, inarticulate, helpless, like a worm
by the way-side, crushed, bleeding, lifeless; but
now, bursting from the deadly bands that &#8216;bound
them,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With Styx nine times round them,&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">my ideas float on winged words, and as they expand
their plumes, catch the golden light of other years.
My soul has indeed remained in its original bondage,
dark, obscure, with longings infinite and unsatisfied;
my heart, shut up in the prison-house of
this rude clay, has never found, nor will it ever find,
a heart to speak to; but that my understanding
also did not remain dumb and brutish, or at length
found a language to express itself, I owe to Coleridge.
But this is not to my purpose.</p>

<p>My father lived ten miles from Shrewsbury, and
was in the habit of exchanging visits with Mr. Rowe,
and with Mr. Jenkins of Whitchurch (nine miles
farther on) according to the custom of Dissenting
Ministers in each other&#8217;s neighbourhood. A line of
communication is thus established, by which the
flame of civil and religious liberty is kept alive, and
nourishes its smouldering fire unquenchable, like
the fires in the <i>Agamemnon</i> of Aeschylus, placed at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
different stations, that waited for ten long years to
announce with their blazing pyramids the destruction
of Troy. Coleridge had agreed to come over
to see my father, according to the courtesy of the
country, as Mr. Rowe&#8217;s probable successor; but in
the meantime I had gone to hear him preach the
Sunday after his arrival. A poet and a philosopher
getting up into a Unitarian pulpit to preach the
Gospel, was a romance in these degenerate days, a
sort of revival of the primitive spirit of Christianity,
which was not to be resisted.</p>

<p>It was in January, 1798, that I rose one morning
before daylight, to walk ten miles in the mud, to
hear this celebrated person preach. Never, the
longest day I have to live, shall I have such another
walk as this cold, raw, comfortless one, in the
winter of the year 1798. <i>Il y a des impressions que
ni le temps ni les circonstances peuvent effacer.
Duss&eacute;-je vivre des si&egrave;cles entiers, le doux temps de
ma jeunesse ne peut renaitre pour moi, ni s&#8217;effacer
jamais dans ma m&eacute;moire.</i> When I got there, the
organ was playing the 100th psalm, and, when it
was done, Mr. Coleridge rose and gave out his text,
&#8216;And he went up into the mountain to pray,
<small>HIMSELF, ALONE</small>.&#8217; As he gave out this text, his
voice &#8216;rose like a steam of rich distilled perfumes,&#8217;
and when he came to the two last words, which he
pronounced loud, deep, and distinct, it seemed to
me, who was then young, as if the sounds had
echoed from the bottom of the human heart, and
as if that prayer might have floated in solemn
silence through the universe. The idea of St. John
came into mind, &#8216;of one crying in the wilderness,
who had his loins girt about, and whose food was
locusts and wild honey.&#8217; The preacher then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
launched into his subject, like an eagle dallying
with the wind. The sermon was upon peace and
war; upon church and state&mdash;not their alliance,
but their separation&mdash;on the spirit of the world and
the spirit of Christianity, not as the same, but as
opposed to one another. He talked of those who
had &#8216;inscribed the cross of Christ on banners dripping
with human gore.&#8217; He made a poetical and
pastoral excursion,&mdash;and to show the fatal effects
of war, drew a striking contrast between the simple
shepherd boy, driving his team afield, or sitting
under the hawthorn, piping to his flock, &#8216;as though
he should never be old,&#8217; and the same poor country-lad,
crimped, kidnapped, brought into town, made
drunk at an alehouse, turned into a wretched
drummer-boy, with his hair sticking on end with
powder and pomatum, a long cue at his back, and
tricked out in the loathsome finery of the profession
of blood.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Such were the notes our once-lov&#8217;d poet sung.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">And for myself, I could not have been more
delighted if I had heard the music of the spheres.
Poetry and Philosophy had met together, Truth
and Genius had embraced, under the eye and with
the sanction of Religion. This was even beyond
my hopes. I returned home well satisfied. The
sun that was still labouring pale and wan through
the sky, obscured by thick mists, seemed an
emblem of the <i>good cause</i>; and the cold dank
drops of dew that hung half-melted on the beard
of the thistle, had something genial and refreshing
in them; for there was a spirit of hope and youth
in all nature, that turned everything into good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
The face of nature had not then the brand of <span class="smcap">Jus
Divinum</span> on it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Like to that sanguine flower inscrib&#8217;d with woe.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On the Tuesday following, the half-inspired
speaker came. I was called down into the room
where he was, and went half-hoping, half-afraid.
He received me very graciously, and I listened
for a long time without uttering a word. I did
not suffer in his opinion by my silence. &#8216;For
those two hours,&#8217; he afterwards was pleased to
say, &#8216;he was conversing with W. H.&#8217;s forehead!&#8217;
His appearance was different from what I had
anticipated from seeing him before. At a distance,
and in the dim light of the chapel, there was to me
a strange wildness in his aspect, a dusky obscurity,
and I thought him pitted with the small-pox.
His complexion was at that time clear, and even
bright&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As are the children of yon azure sheen.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">His forehead was broad and high, light as if built of
ivory, with large projecting eyebrows, and his eyes
rolling beneath them like a sea with darkened
lustre. &#8216;A certain tender bloom his face o&#8217;erspread,&#8217;
a purple tinge as we see it in the pale thoughtful
complexions of the Spanish portrait-painters,
Murillo and Velasquez. His mouth was gross,
voluptuous, open, eloquent; his chin good-humoured
and round; but his nose, the rudder of
the face, the index of the will, was small, feeble,
nothing&mdash;like what he has done. It might seem
that the genius of his face as from a height surveyed
and projected him (with sufficient capacity and
huge aspiration) into the world unknown of thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and imagination, with nothing to support or guide
his veering purpose, as if Columbus had launched
his adventurous course for the New World in
a scallop, without oars or compass. So at least
I comment on it after the event. Coleridge in his
person was rather above the common size, inclining
to the corpulent, or like Lord Hamlet, &#8216;somewhat
fat and pursy.&#8217; His hair (now, alas! grey) was
then black and glossy as the raven&#8217;s, and fell in
smooth masses over his forehead. This long
pendulous hair is peculiar to enthusiasts, to those
whose minds tend heavenward; and is traditionally
inseparable (though of a different colour) from the
pictures of Christ. It ought to belong, as a character
to all who preach <i>Christ crucified</i>, and Coleridge
was at that time one of those!</p>

<p>It was curious to observe the contrast between
him and my father, who was a veteran in the
cause, and then declining into the vale of years.
He had been a poor Irish lad, carefully brought
up by his parents, and sent to the University of
Glasgow (where he studied under Adam Smith)
to prepare him for his future destination. It was
his mother&#8217;s proudest wish to see her son a Dissenting
Minister. So if we look back to past
generations (as far as eye can reach) we see the
same hopes, fears, wishes, followed by the same
disappointments, throbbing in the human heart;
and so we may see them (if we look forward) rising
up for ever, and disappearing, like vapourish
bubbles, in the human breast! After being tossed
about from congregation to congregation in the
heats of the Unitarian controversy, and squabbles
about the American war, he had been relegated
to an obscure village, where he was to spend the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
last thirty years of his life, far from the only
converse that he loved, the talk about disputed
texts of Scripture and the cause of civil and
religious liberty. Here he passed his days,
repining but resigned, in the study of the Bible,
and the perusal of the Commentators&mdash;huge folios,
not easily got through, one of which would outlast
a winter! Why did he pore on these from morn
to night (with the exception of a walk in the fields
or a turn in the garden to gather broccoli-plants
or kidney-beans of his own rearing, with no small
degree of pride and pleasure)?&mdash;Here were &#8216;no
figures nor no fantasies,&#8217;&mdash;neither poetry nor
philosophy&mdash;nothing to dazzle, nothing to excite
modern curiosity; but to his lack-lustre eyes
there appeared, within the pages of the ponderous,
unwieldy, neglected tomes, the sacred name of
JEHOVAH in Hebrew capitals: pressed down
by the weight of the style, worn to the last fading
thinness of the understanding, there were glimpses,
glimmering notions of the patriarchal wanderings,
with palm-trees hovering in the horizon, and
processions of camels at the distance of three
thousand years; there was Moses with the
Burning Bush, the number of the Twelve Tribes,
types, shadows, glosses on the law and the prophets;
there were discussions (dull enough) on the age
of Methuselah, a mighty speculation! there were
outlines, rude guesses at the shape of Noah&#8217;s Ark
and at the riches of Solomon&#8217;s Temple; questions
as to the date of the creation, predictions of the
end of all things; the great lapses of time, the
strange mutations of the globe were unfolded with
the voluminous leaf, as it turned over; and
though the soul might slumber with an hieroglyphic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
veil of inscrutable mysteries drawn over it, yet it
was in a slumber ill-exchanged for all the sharpened
realities of sense, wit, fancy, or reason. My father&#8217;s
life was comparatively a dream; but it was
a dream of infinity and eternity, of death, the
resurrection, and a judgement to come!</p>

<p>No two individuals were ever more unlike than
were the host and his guest. A poet was to my
father a sort of nondescript: yet whatever added
grace to the Unitarian cause was to him welcome.
He could hardly have been more surprised or
pleased, if our visitor had worn wings. Indeed,
his thoughts had wings; and as the silken sounds
rustled round our little wainscoted parlour, my
father threw back his spectacles over his forehead,
his white hairs mixing with its sanguine hue; and
a smile of delight beamed across his rugged cordial
face, to think that Truth had found a new ally
in Fancy!<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Besides, Coleridge seemed to take
considerable notice of me, and that of itself was
enough. He talked very familiarly, but agreeably,
and glanced over a variety of subjects. At dinner-time
he grew more animated, and dilated in a very
edifying manner on Mary Wollstonecraft and
Mackintosh. The last, he said, he considered (on
my father&#8217;s speaking of his <i>Vindiciae Gallicae</i> as
a capital performance) as a clever scholastic man&mdash;a
master of the topics,&mdash;or as the ready warehouseman
of letters, who knew exactly where to
lay his hand on what he wanted, though the goods
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>were not his own. He thought him no match for
Burke, either in style or matter. Burke was
a metaphysician, Mackintosh a mere logician.
Burke was an orator (almost a poet) who reasoned
in figures, because he had an eye for nature:
Mackintosh, on the other hand, was a rhetorician,
who had only an eye to commonplaces. On this
I ventured to say that I had always entertained
a great opinion of Burke, and that (as far as I could
find) the speaking of him with contempt might be
made the test of a vulgar democratical mind. This
was the first observation I ever made to Coleridge,
and he said it was a very just and striking one.
I remember the leg of Welsh mutton and the
turnips on the table that day had the finest flavour
imaginable. Coleridge added that Mackintosh and
Tom Wedgwood (of whom, however, he spoke
highly) had expressed a very indifferent opinion
of his friend Mr. Wordsworth, on which he
remarked to them&mdash;&#8216;He strides on so far before
you, that he dwindles in the distance!&#8217; Godwin
had once boasted to him of having carried on an
argument with Mackintosh for three hours with
dubious success; Coleridge told him&mdash;&#8216;If there
had been a man of genius in the room he would
have settled the question in five minutes.&#8217; He
asked me if I had ever seen Mary Wollstonecraft,
and I said, I had once for a few moments, and that
she seemed to me to turn off Godwin&#8217;s objections
to something she advanced with quite a playful,
easy air. He replied, that &#8216;this was only one
instance of the ascendancy which people of
imagination exercised over those of mere intellect.&#8217;
He did not rate Godwin very high<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> (this was caprice
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>or prejudice, real or affected) but he had a great
idea of Mrs. Wollstonecraft&#8217;s powers of conversation,
none at all of her talent for book-making. We
talked a little about Holcroft. He had been asked
if he was not much struck <i>with</i> him, and he said,
he thought himself in more danger of being struck
<i>by</i> him. I complained that he would not let me
get on at all, for he required a definition of every
the commonest word, exclaiming, &#8216;What do you
mean by a <i>sensation</i>, Sir? What do you mean by
an <i>idea</i>?&#8217; This, Coleridge said, was barricadoing
the road to truth:&mdash;it was setting up a turnpike-gate
at every step we took. I forget a great
number of things, many more than I remember;
but the day passed off pleasantly, and the next
morning Mr. Coleridge was to return to Shrewsbury.
When I came down to breakfast, I found that he
had just received a letter from his friend, T. Wedgwood,
making him an offer of 150<i>l.</i> a year if he
chose to waive his present pursuit, and devote
himself entirely to the study of poetry and
philosophy. Coleridge seemed to make up his
mind to close with this proposal in the act of
tying on one of his shoes. It threw an additional
damp on his departure. It took the wayward
enthusiast quite from us to cast him into Deva&#8217;s
winding vales, or by the shores of old romance.
Instead of living at ten miles&#8217; distance, of being
the pastor of a Dissenting congregation at Shrewsbury,
he was henceforth to inhabit the Hill of
Parnassus, to be a Shepherd on the Delectable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>Mountains. Alas! I knew not the way thither,
and felt very little gratitude for Mr. Wedgwood&#8217;s
bounty. I was presently relieved from this
dilemma; for Mr. Coleridge, asking for a pen and
ink, and going to a table to write something on
a bit of card, advanced towards me with undulating
step, and giving me the precious document, said
that that was his address, <i>Mr. Coleridge, Nether-Stowey,
Somersetshire</i>; and that he should be
glad to see me there in a few weeks&#8217; time, and, if
I chose, would come half-way to meet me. I was
not less surprised than the shepherd-boy (this
simile is to be found in <i>Cassandra</i>) when he sees
a thunderbolt fall close at his feet. I stammered
out my acknowledgements and acceptance of this
offer (I thought Mr. Wedgwood&#8217;s annuity a trifle
to it) as well as I could; and this mighty business
being settled, the poet-preacher took leave, and
I accompanied him six miles on the road. It was
a fine morning in the middle of winter, and he
talked the whole way. The scholar in Chaucer is
described as going</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;Sounding on his way.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">So Coleridge went on his. In digressing, in dilating,
in passing from subject to subject, he appeared to
me to float in air, to slide on ice. He told me in
confidence (going along) that he should have
preached two sermons before he accepted the
situation at Shrewsbury, one on Infant Baptism,
the other on the Lord&#8217;s Supper, showing that he
could not administer either, which would have
effectually disqualified him for the object in view.
I observed that he continually crossed me on the
way by shifting from one side of the footpath to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the other. This struck me as an odd movement;
but I did not at that time connect it with any
instability of purpose or involuntary change of
principle, as I have done since. He seemed unable
to keep on in a straight line. He spoke slightingly
of Hume (whose Essay on Miracles he said was
stolen from an objection started in one of South&#8217;s
Sermons&mdash;<i>Credat Judaeus Apella!</i>). I was not
very much pleased at this account of Hume, for
I had just been reading, with infinite relish, that
completest of all metaphysical <i>choke-pears</i>, his
<i>Treatise on Human Nature</i>, to which the <i>Essays</i>,
in point of scholastic subtlety and close reasoning,
are mere elegant trifling, light summer-reading.
Coleridge even denied the excellence of Hume&#8217;s
general style, which I think betrayed a want of taste
or candour. He however made me amends by the
manner in which he spoke of Berkeley. He dwelt
particularly on his <i>Essay on Vision</i> as a masterpiece
of analytical reasoning. So it undoubtedly is.
He was exceedingly angry with Dr. Johnson for
striking the stone with his foot, in allusion to this
author&#8217;s Theory of Matter and Spirit, and saying,
&#8216;Thus I confute him, Sir.&#8217; Coleridge drew
a parallel (I don&#8217;t know how he brought about
the connexion) between Bishop Berkeley and Tom
Paine. He said the one was an instance of a subtle,
the other of an acute mind, than which no two
things could be more distinct. The one was
a shop-boy&#8217;s quality, the other the characteristic
of a philosopher. He considered Bishop Butler as
a true philosopher, a profound and conscientious
thinker, a genuine reader of nature and his own
mind. He did not speak of his <i>Analogy</i>, but of his
<i>Sermons at the Rolls&#8217; Chapel</i>, of which I had never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
heard. Coleridge somehow always contrived to
prefer the <i>unknown</i> to the <i>known</i>. In this instance
he was right. The <i>Analogy</i> is a tissue of sophistry,
of wire-drawn, theological special-pleading; the
<i>Sermons</i> (with the Preface to them) are in a fine
vein of deep, matured reflection, a candid appeal
to our observation of human nature, without
pedantry and without bias. I told Coleridge
I had written a few remarks, and was sometimes
foolish enough to believe that I had made a discovery
on the same subject (the <i>Natural Disinterestedness
of the Human Mind</i>)&mdash;and I tried to explain my
view of it to Coleridge, who listened with great
willingness, but I did not succeed in making
myself understood. I sat down to the task shortly
afterwards for the twentieth time, got new pens
and paper, determined to make clear work of it,
wrote a few meagre sentences in the skeleton style
of a mathematical demonstration, stopped half-way
down the second page; and, after trying in vain
to pump up any words, images, notions, apprehensions,
facts, or observations, from that gulf of
abstraction in which I had plunged myself for four
or five years preceding, gave up the attempt as
labour in vain, and shed tears of helpless despondency
on the blank unfinished paper. I can
write fast enough now. Am I better than I was
then? Oh no! One truth discovered, one pang
of regret at not being able to express it, is better
than all the fluency and flippancy in the world.
Would that I could go back to what I then was!
Why can we not revive past times as we can
revisit old places? If I had the quaint Muse of
Sir Philip Sidney to assist me, I would write
a <i>Sonnet to the Road between Wem and Shrewsbury</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and immortalize every step of it by some fond
enigmatical conceit. I would swear that the very
milestones had ears, and that Harmer-hill stooped
with all its pines, to listen to a poet, as he passed!
I remember but one other topic of discourse in this
walk. He mentioned Paley, praised the naturalness
and clearness of his style, but condemned
his sentiments, thought him a mere time-serving
casuist, and said that &#8216;the fact of his work on
Moral and Political Philosophy being made a text-book
in our Universities was a disgrace to the
national character.&#8217; We parted at the six-mile
stone; and I returned homeward pensive but
much pleased. I had met with unexpected notice
from a person whom I believed to have been
prejudiced against me. &#8216;Kind and affable to me
had been his condescension, and should be honoured
ever with suitable regard.&#8217; He was the first poet
I had known, and he certainly answered to that
inspired name. I had heard a great deal of his
powers of conversation, and was not disappointed.
In fact, I never met with any thing at all like
them, either before or since. I could easily credit
the accounts which were circulated of his holding
forth to a large party of ladies and gentlemen, an
evening or two before, on the Berkeleian Theory,
when he made the whole material universe look
like a transparency of fine words; and another
story (which I believe he has somewhere told
himself) of his being asked to a party at Birmingham,
of his smoking tobacco and going to sleep after
dinner on a sofa, where the company found him
to their no small surprise, which was increased to
wonder when he started up of a sudden, and
rubbing his eyes, looked about him, and launched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
into a three hours&#8217; description of the third heaven,
of which he had had a dream, very different from
Mr. Southey&#8217;s Vision of Judgement, and also from
that other Vision of Judgement, which Mr. Murray,
the Secretary of the Bridge Street Junto, has taken
into his especial keeping.</p>

<p>On my way back, I had a sound in my ears, it
was the voice of Fancy: I had a light before me,
it was the face of Poetry. The one still lingers
there, the other has not quitted my side! Coleridge
in truth met me half-way on the ground of
philosophy, or I should not have been won over
to his imaginative creed. I had an uneasy,
pleasurable sensation all the time, till I was to
visit him. During those months the chill breath
of winter gave me a welcoming; the vernal air
was balm and inspiration to me. The golden
sunsets, the silver star of evening, lighted me on
my way to new hopes and prospects. <i>I was to
visit Coleridge in the Spring.</i> This circumstance
was never absent from my thoughts, and mingled
with all my feelings. I wrote to him at the time
proposed, and received an answer postponing my
intended visit for a week or two, but very cordially
urging me to complete my promise then. This
delay did not damp, but rather increase my ardour.
In the meantime I went to Llangollen Vale, by
way of initiating myself in the mysteries of natural
scenery; and I must say I was enchanted with it.
I had been reading Coleridge&#8217;s description of
England, in his fine <i>Ode on the Departing Year</i>,
and I applied it, <i>con amore</i>, to the objects before
me. That valley was to me (in a manner) the cradle
of a new existence: in the river that winds through
it, my spirit was baptized in the waters of Helicon!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>I returned home, and soon after set out on my
journey with unworn heart and untried feet. My
way lay through Worcester and Gloucester, and
by Upton, where I thought of Tom Jones and
the adventure of the muff. I remember getting
completely wet through one day, and stopping
at an inn (I think it was at Tewkesbury) where
I sat up all night to read <i>Paul and Virginia</i>.
Sweet were the showers in early youth that
drenched my body, and sweet the drops of pity
that fell upon the books I read! I recollect
a remark of Coleridge&#8217;s upon this very book, that
nothing could show the gross indelicacy of French
manners and the entire corruption of their imagination
more strongly than the behaviour of the
heroine in the last fatal scene, who turns away
from a person on board the sinking vessel, that
offers to save her life, because he has thrown off
his clothes to assist him in swimming. Was this
a time to think of such a circumstance? I once
hinted to Wordsworth, as we were sailing in his
boat on Grasmere lake, that I thought he had
borrowed the idea of his <i>Poems on the Naming of
Places</i> from the local inscriptions of the same kind
in <i>Paul and Virginia</i>. He did not own the
obligation, and stated some distinction without
a difference, in defence of his claim to originality.
And the slightest variation would be sufficient for
this purpose in his mind; for whatever <i>he</i> added
or omitted would inevitably be worth all that any
one else had done, and contain the marrow of the
sentiment.&mdash;I was still two days before the time
fixed for my arrival, for I had taken care to set
out early enough. I stopped these two days at
Bridgewater, and when I was tired of sauntering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
on the banks of its muddy river, returned to the
inn, and read <i>Camilla</i>. So have I loitered my life
away, reading books, looking at pictures, going to
plays, hearing, thinking, writing on what pleased
me best. I have wanted only one thing to make
me happy; but wanting that, have wanted everything!</p>

<p>I arrived, and was well received. The country
about Nether Stowey is beautiful, green and hilly,
and near the sea-shore. I saw it but the other day,
after an interval of twenty years, from a hill near
Taunton. How was the map of my life spread out
before me, as the map of the country lay at my feet!
In the afternoon, Coleridge took me over to All-Foxden,
a romantic old family mansion of the
St. Aubins, where Wordsworth lived. It was then
in the possession of a friend of the poet&#8217;s, who gave
him the free use of it. Somehow that period (the
time just after the French Revolution) was not
a time when <i>nothing was given for nothing</i>. The
mind opened, and a softness might be perceived
coming over the heart of individuals, beneath &#8216;the
scales that fence&#8217; our self-interest. Wordsworth
himself was from home, but his sister kept house,
and set before us a frugal repast; and we had free
access to her brother&#8217;s poems, the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>,
which were still in manuscript, or in the form of
<i>Sibylline Leaves</i>. I dipped into a few of these with
great satisfaction, and with the faith of a novice.
I slept that night in an old room with blue hangings,
and covered with the round-faced family-portraits
of the age of George I and II, and from the wooded
declivity of the adjoining park that overlooked my
window, at the dawn of day, could</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;hear the loud stag speak.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the outset of life (and particularly at this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
time I felt it so) our imagination has a body to it.
We are in a state between sleeping and waking,
and have indistinct but glorious glimpses of strange
shapes, and there is always something to come
better than what we see. As in our dreams the
fullness of the blood gives warmth and reality to
the coinage of the brain, so in youth our ideas
are clothed, and fed, and pampered with our
good spirits; we breathe thick with thoughtless
happiness, the weight of future years presses
on the strong pulses of the heart, and we repose
with undisturbed faith in truth and good. As
we advance, we exhaust our fund of enjoyment
and of hope. We are no longer wrapped in <i>lamb&#8217;s-wool</i>,
lulled in Elysium. As we taste the pleasures
of life, their spirit evaporates, the sense palls; and
nothing is left but the phantoms, the lifeless
shadows of what <i>has been</i>!</p>

<p>That morning, as soon as breakfast was over, we
strolled out into the park, and seating ourselves on
the trunk of an old ash-tree that stretched along
the ground, Coleridge read aloud with a sonorous
and musical voice, the ballad of <i>Betty Foy</i>. I was
not critically or sceptically inclined. I saw touches
of truth and nature, and took the rest for granted.
But in the <i>Thorn</i>, the <i>Mad Mother</i>, and the
<i>Complaint of a Poor Indian Woman</i>, I felt that
deeper power and pathos which have been since
acknowledged,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In spite of pride, in erring reason&#8217;s spite,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">as the characteristics of this author; and the
sense of a new style and a new spirit in poetry
came over me. It had to me something of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
effect that arises from the turning up of the fresh
soil, or of the first welcome breath of Spring,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While yet the trembling year is unconfirmed.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Coleridge and myself walked back to Stowey that
evening, and his voice sounded high</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of Providence, foreknowledge, will, and fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fix&#8217;d fate, free-will, foreknowledge absolute,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">as we passed through echoing grove, by fairy
stream or waterfall, gleaming in the summer
moonlight! He lamented that Wordsworth was
not prone enough to believe in the traditional
superstitions of the place, and that there was
a something corporeal, a <i>matter-of-fact-ness</i>, a clinging
to the palpable, or often to the petty, in his
poetry, in consequence. His genius was not
a spirit that descended to him through the air; it
sprung out of the ground like a flower, or unfolded
itself from a green spray, on which the goldfinch
sang. He said, however (if I remember right), that
this objection must be confined to his descriptive
pieces, that his philosophic poetry had a grand
and comprehensive spirit in it, so that his soul
seemed to inhabit the universe like a palace, and
to discover truth by intuition, rather than by
deduction. The next day Wordsworth arrived
from Bristol at Coleridge&#8217;s cottage. I think I see
him now. He answered in some degree to his
friend&#8217;s description of him, but was more gaunt
and Don Quixote-like. He was quaintly dressed
(according to the <i>costume</i> of that unconstrained
period) in a brown fustian jacket and striped
pantaloons. There was something of a roll,
a lounge in his gait, not unlike his own Peter Bell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
There was a severe, worn pressure of thought
about his temples, a fire in his eye (as if he saw
something in objects more than the outward
appearance), an intense high narrow forehead,
a Roman nose, cheeks furrowed by strong purpose
and feeling, and a convulsive inclination to
laughter about the mouth, a good deal at variance
with the solemn, stately expression of the rest of
his face. Chantrey&#8217;s bust wants the marking
traits; but he was teased into making it regular
and heavy: Haydon&#8217;s head of him, introduced
into the <i>Entrance of Christ into Jerusalem</i>, is the
most like his drooping weight of thought and
expression. He sat down and talked very naturally
and freely, with a mixture of clear gushing accents
in his voice, a deep guttural intonation, and
a strong tincture of the northern <i>burr</i>, like the
crust on wine. He instantly began to make havoc
of the half of a Cheshire cheese on the table, and
said triumphantly that &#8216;his marriage with experience
had not been so productive as Mr. Southey&#8217;s
in teaching him a knowledge of the good things of
this life.&#8217; He had been to see the <i>Castle Spectre</i> by
Monk Lewis, while at Bristol, and described it very
well. He said &#8216;it fitted the taste of the audience
like a glove.&#8217; This <i>ad captandum</i> merit was, however,
by no means a recommendation of it, according
to the severe principles of the new school, which
reject rather than court popular effect. Wordsworth,
looking out of the low, latticed window,
said, &#8216;How beautifully the sun sets on that
yellow bank!&#8217; I thought within myself, &#8216;With
what eyes these poets see nature!&#8217; and ever after,
when I saw the sunset stream upon the objects
facing it, conceived I had made a discovery, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
thanked Mr. Wordsworth for having made one for
me! We went over to All-Foxden again the day
following, and Wordsworth read us the story of
Peter Bell in the open air; and the comment
made upon it by his face and voice was very
different from that of some later critics! Whatever
might be thought of the poem, &#8216;his face was as
a book where men might read strange matters,&#8217;
and he announced the fate of his hero in prophetic
tones. There is a <i>chaunt</i> in the recitation both of
Coleridge and Wordsworth, which acts as a spell
upon the hearer, and disarms the judgement.
Perhaps they have deceived themselves by making
habitual use of this ambiguous accompaniment.
Coleridge&#8217;s manner is more full, animated, and
varied; Wordsworth&#8217;s more equable, sustained,
and internal. The one might be termed more
<i>dramatic</i>, the other more <i>lyrical</i>. Coleridge has
told me that he himself liked to compose in walking
over uneven ground, or breaking through the
straggling branches of a copse wood; whereas
Wordsworth always wrote (if he could) walking
up and down a straight gravel-walk, or in some
spot where the continuity of his verse met with
no collateral interruption. Returning that same
evening, I got into a metaphysical argument with
Wordsworth, while Coleridge was explaining the
different notes of the nightingale to his sister, in
which we neither of us succeeded in making
ourselves perfectly clear and intelligible. Thus
I passed three weeks at Nether Stowey and in the
neighbourhood, generally devoting the afternoons
to a delightful chat in an arbour made of bark by
the poet&#8217;s friend Tom Poole, sitting under two
fine elm-trees, and listening to the bees humming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
round us, while we quaffed our <i>flip</i>. It was agreed,
among other things, that we should make a jaunt
down the Bristol Channel, as far as Lynton. We
set off together on foot, Coleridge, John Chester,
and I. This Chester was a native of Nether Stowey,
one of those who were attracted to Coleridge&#8217;s
discourse as flies are to honey, or bees in swarming-time
to the sound of a brass pan. He &#8216;followed
in the chace, like a dog who hunts, not like one
that made up the cry.&#8217; He had on a brown cloth
coat, boots, and corduroy breeches, was low in
stature, bow-legged, had a drag in his walk like
a drover, which he assisted by a hazel switch, and
kept on a sort of trot by the side of Coleridge, like
a running footman by a state coach, that he might
not lose a syllable or sound, that fell from Coleridge&#8217;s
lips. He told me his private opinion, that Coleridge
was a wonderful man. He scarcely opened his lips,
much less offered an opinion the whole way: yet
of the three, had I to choose during that journey,
I would be John Chester. He afterwards followed
Coleridge into Germany, where the Kantean
philosophers were puzzled how to bring him under
any of their categories. When he sat down at
table with his idol, John&#8217;s felicity was complete;
Sir Walter Scott&#8217;s, or Mr. Blackwood&#8217;s, when they
sat down at the same table with the King, was not
more so. We passed Dunster on our right, a small
town between the brow of a hill and the sea.
I remember eyeing it wistfully as it lay below us:
contrasted with the woody scene around, it looked
as clear, as pure, as <i>embrowned</i> and ideal as any
landscape I have seen since, of Gaspar Poussin&#8217;s
or Domenichino&#8217;s. We had a long day&#8217;s march&mdash;(our
feet kept time to the echoes of Coleridge&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
tongue)&mdash;through Minehead and by the Blue
Anchor, and on to Lynton, which we did not reach
till near midnight, and where we had some
difficulty in making a lodgement. We, however,
knocked the people of the house up at last, and we
were repaid for our apprehensions and fatigue by
some excellent rashers of fried bacon and eggs.
The view in coming along had been splendid.
We walked for miles and miles on dark brown
heaths overlooking the channel, with the Welsh
hills beyond, and at times descended into little
sheltered valleys close by the sea-side, with
a smuggler&#8217;s face scowling by us, and then had
to ascend conical hills with a path winding up
through a coppice to a barren top, like a monk&#8217;s
shaven crown, from one of which I pointed out to
Coleridge&#8217;s notice the bare masts of a vessel on
the very edge of the horizon, and within the red-orbed
disk of the setting sun, like his own spectre-ship
in the <i>Ancient Mariner</i>. At Lynton the
character of the sea-coast becomes more marked
and rugged. There is a place called the &#8216;Valley of
Rocks&#8217; (I suspect this was only the poetical name
for it) bedded among precipices overhanging the
sea, with rocky caverns beneath, into which the
waves dash, and where the sea-gull for ever wheels
its screaming flight. On the tops of these are huge
stones thrown transverse, as if an earthquake had
tossed them there, and behind these is a fretwork
of perpendicular rocks, something like the &#8216;Giant&#8217;s
Causeway&#8217;. A thunder-storm came on while we
were at the inn, and Coleridge was running out
bareheaded to enjoy the commotion of the
elements in the &#8216;Valley of Rocks&#8217;, but as if in spite,
the clouds only muttered a few angry sounds, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
let fall a few refreshing drops. Coleridge told me
that he and Wordsworth were to have made this
place the scene of a prose-tale, which was to have
been in the manner of, but far superior to, the
<i>Death of Abel</i>, but they had relinquished the
design. In the morning of the second day, we
breakfasted luxuriously in an old-fashioned parlour
on tea, toast, eggs, and honey, in the very sight of
the bee-hives from which it had been taken, and
a garden full of thyme and wild flowers that had
produced it. On this occasion Coleridge spoke
of Virgil&#8217;s <i>Georgics</i>, but not well. I do not think
he had much feeling for the classical or elegant.
It was in this room that we found a little worn-out
copy of the <i>Seasons</i>, lying in a window-seat, on
which Coleridge exclaimed, &#8216;<i>That</i> is true fame!&#8217;
He said Thomson was a great poet, rather than
a good one; his style was as meretricious as his
thoughts were natural. He spoke of Cowper as
the best modern poet. He said the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>
were an experiment about to be tried by him and
Wordsworth, to see how far the public taste would
endure poetry written in a more natural and simple
style than had hitherto been attempted; totally
discarding the artifices of poetical diction, and
making use only of such words as had probably
been common in the most ordinary language since
the days of Henry II. Some comparison was
introduced between Shakespeare and Milton. He
said &#8216;he hardly knew which to prefer. Shakespeare
appeared to him a mere stripling in the art; he
was as tall and as strong, with infinitely more
activity than Milton, but he never appeared to
have come to man&#8217;s estate; or if he had, he would
not have been a man, but a monster.&#8217; He spoke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
with contempt of Gray, and with intolerance of
Pope. He did not like the versification of the
latter. He observed that &#8216;the ears of these
couplet-writers might be charged with having
short memories, that could not retain the harmony
of whole passages.&#8217; He thought little of Junius
as a writer; he had a dislike of Dr. Johnson;
and a much higher opinion of Burke as an orator
and politician, than of Fox or Pitt. He however
thought him very inferior in richness of style and
imagery to some of our elder prose-writers,
particularly Jeremy Taylor. He liked Richardson,
but not Fielding; nor could I get him to enter into
the merits of <i>Caleb Williams</i>.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> In short, he was
profound and discriminating with respect to those
authors whom he liked, and where he gave his
judgement fair play; capricious, perverse, and
prejudiced in his antipathies and distastes. We
loitered on the &#8216;ribbed sea-sands&#8217;, in such talk as
this, a whole morning, and I recollect met with
a curious sea-weed, of which John Chester told us
the country name! A fisherman gave Coleridge
an account of a boy that had been drowned the
day before, and that they had tried to save him
at the risk of their own lives. He said &#8216;he did not
know how it was that they ventured, but, Sir, we
have a <i>nature</i> towards one another.&#8217; This expression,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>Coleridge remarked to me, was a fine illustration
of that theory of disinterestedness which I (in
common with Butler) had adopted. I broached
to him an argument of mine to prove that <i>likeness</i>
was not mere association of ideas. I said that the
mark in the sand put one in mind of a man&#8217;s foot,
not because it was part of a former impression of
a man&#8217;s foot (for it was quite new) but because it
was like the shape of a man&#8217;s foot. He assented
to the justness of this distinction (which I have
explained at length elsewhere, for the benefit of
the curious) and John Chester listened; not from
any interest in the subject, but because he was
astonished that I should be able to suggest anything
to Coleridge that he did not already know.
We returned on the third morning, and Coleridge
remarked the silent cottage-smoke curling up the
valleys where, a few evenings before, we had seen
the lights gleaming through the dark.</p>

<p>In a day or two after we arrived at Stowey, we
set out, I on my return home, and he for Germany.
It was a Sunday morning, and he was to preach
that day for Dr. Toulmin of Taunton. I asked him
if he had prepared anything for the occasion?
He said he had not even thought of the text, but
should as soon as we parted. I did not go to hear
him,&mdash;this was a fault,&mdash;but we met in the evening
at Bridgewater. The next day we had a long day&#8217;s
walk to Bristol, and sat down, I recollect, by
a well-side on the road, to cool ourselves and
satisfy our thirst, when Coleridge repeated to me
some descriptive lines of his tragedy of <i>Remorse</i>;
which I must say became his mouth and that
occasion better than they, some years after, did
Mr. Elliston&#8217;s and the Drury Lane boards,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh memory! shield me from the world&#8217;s poor strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give those scenes thine everlasting life.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I saw no more of him for a year or two, during
which period he had been wandering in the Hartz
Forest in Germany; and his return was cometary,
meteorous, unlike his setting out. It was not till
some time after that I knew his friends Lamb and
Southey. The last always appears to me (as I first
saw him) with a commonplace book under his arm,
and the first with a <i>bon-mot</i> in his mouth. It was
at Godwin&#8217;s that I met him with Holcroft and
Coleridge, where they were disputing fiercely
which was the best&mdash;<i>Man as he was, or man as he
is to be</i>. &#8216;Give me&#8217;, says Lamb, &#8216;man as he is <i>not</i>
to be.&#8217; This saying was the beginning of a friendship
between us, which I believe still continues.&mdash;Enough
of this for the present.</p>

Buffamalco and others; of one in particular, where Death
is seen in the air brandishing his scythe, and the great and
mighty of the earth shudder at his approach, while the
beggars and the wretched kneel to him as their deliverer.
He would, of course, understand so broad and fine a moral
as this at any time.</p></div>

<h3>SACRED POETRY (1825)</h3>

<h4><i>The Star in the East; with other Poems.</i> By
Josiah Conder. London. 1824.</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are many circumstances about this little
volume, which tend powerfully to disarm criticism.
In the first place, it is, for the most part, of a <i>sacred</i>
character: taken up with those subjects which
least of all admit, with propriety, either in the
author or critic, the exercise of intellectual subtlety.
For the <i>practical</i> tendency, indeed, of such compositions,
both are most deeply responsible; the
author who publishes, and the critic who undertakes
to recommend or to censure them. But if they
appear to be written with any degree of sincerity
and earnestness, we naturally shrink from treating
them merely as literary efforts. To interrupt the
current of a reader&#8217;s sympathy in such a case, by
critical objections, is not merely to deprive him of
a little harmless pleasure, it is to disturb him almost
in a devotional exercise. The most considerate
reviewer, therefore, of a volume of sacred poetry,
will think it a subject on which it is easier to say too
much than too little.</p>

<p>In the present instance, this consideration is enforced
by the unpretending tone of the volume,
which bears internal evidence, for the most part, of
not having been written to meet the eye of the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
It is in vain to say that this claim on the critic&#8217;s
favour is nullified by publication. The author may
give it up, and yet the work may retain it. We may
still feel that we have no right to judge severely of
what was not, at first, intended to come before our
judgement at all. This of course applies only to
those compositions, which indicate, by something
within themselves, this freedom from the pretension
of authorship. And such are most of those to
which we are now bespeaking our readers&#8217; attention.</p>

<p><i>Most</i> of them, we say, because the first poem in
the volume, <i>The Star in the East</i>, is of a more ambitious
and less pleasing character. Although in
blank verse, it is, in fact, a lyrical effusion; an ode
on the rapid progress and final triumph of the Gospel.
It looks like the composition of a young man:
harsh and turgid in parts, but interspersed with
some rather beautiful touches. The opening lines
are a fair specimen.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Notwithstanding beauties scattered here and
there, there is an effort and constrained stateliness
in the poem, very different from the rapidity and
simplicity of many of the shorter lyrics, which follow
under the titles of Sacred and Domestic Poems.
Such, for instance, as the Poor Man&#8217;s Hymn</p>

<p>Now, what is the reason of the great difference
between these extracts and that from the <i>Star in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
East</i>?&mdash;a difference which the earlier date of the
latter, so far from accounting for, only makes the
more extraordinary. In some instances, the interval
of time is very short, but at all events more effort
and turgidness might have been expected in the
earlier poems, more simplicity and care and a more
subdued tone in the later. We suspect a reason,
which both poets and poetical readers are too apt
to leave out of sight. There is a want of <i>truth</i> in
the <i>Star in the East</i>&mdash;not that the author is otherwise
than quite in earnest&mdash;but his earnestness
seems rather an artificial glow, to which he has been
worked up by reading and conversation of a particular
cast, than the overflowing warmth of his own natural
feelings, kindled by circumstances in which he was
himself placed. In a word, when he writes of the
success of the Bible Society, and the supposed
amelioration of the world in consequence, he writes
from report and fancy only; but when he speaks
of a happy home, of kindly affections, of the comforts
which piety can administer in disappointment
and sorrow; either we are greatly mistaken, or he
speaks from real and present experience. The
poetical result is what the reader has seen:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;mens onus reponit, et peregrino<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Labore fessi venimus Larem ad nostrum&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">We turn gladly from our fairy voyage round the
world to refresh ourselves with a picture, which we
feel to be drawn from the life, of a happy and
innocent fireside. Nor is it, in the slightest degree,
derogatory to an author&#8217;s talent to say that he has
failed, comparatively, on that subject of which he
must have known comparatively little.</p>

<p>Let us here pause a moment to explain what is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
meant when we speak of such prospects as are above
alluded to, being shadowy and unreal in respect of
what is matter of experience. It is not that we
doubt the tenor of the Scripture, regarding the final
conversion of the whole world, or that we close our
eyes to the wonderful arrangements, if the expression
may be used, which Divine Providence seems everywhere
making, with a view to that great consummation.
One circumstance, in particular, arrests
our attention, as pervading the whole of modern
history, but gradually standing out in a stronger
light as the view draws nearer our own times: we
mean the rapid increase of colonization <i>from
Christian nations only</i>. So that the larger half of
the globe, and what in the nature of things will soon
become the more populous, is already, in profession,
Christian. The event, therefore, is unquestionable:
but experience, we fear, will hardly warrant the exulting
anticipations, which our author, in common with
many of whose sincerity there is no reason to doubt,
has raised upon it. It is but too conceivable that
the whole world may become nominally Christian,
yet the face of things may be very little changed for
the better. And any view of the progress of the
gospel, whether in verse or in prose, which leaves
out this possibility, is so far wanting in truth, and
in that depth of thought which is as necessary to
the higher kinds of poetical beauty as to philosophy
or theology itself.</p>

<p>This, however, is too solemn and comprehensive
a subject to be lightly or hastily spoken of. It is
enough to have glanced at it, as accounting, in some
measure, for the general failure of modern poets in
their attempts to describe the predicted triumph of
the gospel in the latter days.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>To return to the sacred and domestic poems,
thus advantageously distinguished from that which
gives name to the volume. Affection, whether
heavenly or earthly, is the simplest idea that can
be; and in the graceful and harmonious expression
of it lies the principal beauty of these poems. In
the descriptive parts, and in the development of
abstract sentiment, there is more of effort, and
occasionally something very like affectation: approaching,
in one instance (the <i>Nightingale</i>,) far
nearer than we could wish, to the most vicious of all
styles, the style of Mr. Leigh Hunt and his miserable
followers.</p>

<p>Now, these are just the sort of merit and the sort
of defect, which one might naturally expect to find
united; the very simplicity of attachment, which
qualifies the mind for sacred or domestic poetry,
making its movements awkward and constrained,
when scenes are to be described, or thoughts unravelled
of more complication and less immediate
interest. This is the rather to be observed, as many
other sacred poets have become less generally
pleasing and useful, than they otherwise would have
been, from this very circumstance. The simple
and touching devoutness of many of Bishop Ken&#8217;s
lyrical effusions has been unregarded, because of
the ungraceful contrivances, and heavy movement
of his narrative. The same may be said, in our
own times, of some parts of Montgomery&#8217;s writings.
His bursts of sacred poetry, compared with his
<i>Greenland</i>, remind us of a person singing enchantingly
by ear, but becoming languid and powerless
the moment he sits down to a note-book.</p>

<p>Such writers, it is obvious, do not sufficiently
trust to the command which the simple expression<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of their feelings would obtain over their readers.
They think it must be relieved with something of
more variety and imagery, to which they work
themselves up with laborious, and therefore necessarily
unsuccessful, efforts. The model for correcting
their error is to be found in the inspired volume.
We can, in general, be but incompetent judges of
this, because we have been used to it from our boyhood.
But let us suppose a person, whose ideas of
poetry were entirely gathered from modern compositions,
taking up the Psalms for the first time.
Among many other remarkable differences, he would
surely be impressed with the sacred writer&#8217;s total
carelessness about originality, and what is technically
called <i>effect</i>. He would say, &#8216;This is something
better than merely attractive poetry; it is
absolute and divine truth.&#8217; The same remark ought
to be suggested by all sacred hymns; and it is,
indeed, greatly to be lamented, that such writers as
we have just mentioned should have ever lost sight
of it&mdash;should have had so little confidence in the
power of simplicity, and have condescended so
largely to the laborious refinements of the profane
Muse.</p>

<p>To put the same truth in a light somewhat
different; it is required, we apprehend, in all poets,
but particularly in sacred poets, that they should
seem to write with a view of unburthening their
minds, and not for the sake of writing; for love of
the subject, not of the employment. The distinction
is very striking in descriptive poetry. Compare
the landscapes of Cowper with those of Burns.
There is, if we mistake not, the same sort of difference
between them, as in the conversation of two
persons on scenery, the one originally an enthusiast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
in his love of the works of nature, the other driven,
by disappointment or weariness, to solace himself
with them as he might. It is a contrast which
every one must have observed, when such topics
come under discussion in society; and those who
think it worth while, may find abundant illustration
of it in the writings of this unfortunate but illustrious
pair. The one all overflowing with the love
of nature, and indicating, at every turn, that whatever
his lot in life, he could not have been happy
without her. The other visibly and wisely soothing
himself, but not without effort, by attending to
rural objects, in default of some more congenial
happiness, of which he had almost come to despair.
The latter, in consequence, laboriously sketching
every object that came in his way: the other, in one
or two rapid lines, which operate, as it were, like
a magician&#8217;s spell, presenting to the fancy just that
picture, which was wanted to put the reader&#8217;s mind
in unison with the writer&#8217;s. We would quote, as
an instance, the description of Evening in the Fourth
Book of the <i>Task</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come Ev&#8217;ning, once again, season of peace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Return, sweet Ev&#8217;ning, and continue long!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Methinks I see thee in the streaking west<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With matron-step slow-moving, while the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Treads on thy sweeping train; one hand employ&#8217;d<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In letting fall the curtain of repose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On bird and beast, the other charg&#8217;d for man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sweet oblivion of the cares of day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not sumptuously adorn&#8217;d, nor needing aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like homely-featur&#8217;d night, of clust&#8217;ring gems;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A star or two, just twinkling on thy brow,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Come then, and thou shalt find thy vot&#8217;ry calm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or make me so. Composure is thy gift.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And we would set over against it that purely
pastoral chant:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now rosy May comes in wi&#8217; flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To deck her gay, green spreading bowers;<br /></span>

<span class="i1">And that&#8217;s my ain dear Davie.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Meet me, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is surely no need to explain how this instinctive
attachment to his subject is especially
requisite in the sacred poet. If even the description
of material objects is found to languish without it,
much more will it be looked for when the best and
highest of all affections is to be expressed and communicated
to others. The nobler and worthier the
object, the greater our disappointment to find it
approached with anything like languor or constraint.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>We must just mention one more quality, which
may seem, upon consideration, essential to perfection
in this kind: viz. that the feelings the writer
expresses should appear to be specimens of his
general tone of thought, not sudden bursts and
mere flashes of goodness. Wordsworth&#8217;s beautiful
description of the Stock-dove might not unaptly
be applied to him. He should sing</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&#8216;of love with silence blending,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slow to begin, yet never ending,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of serious faith and inward glee&#8217;.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Some may, perhaps, object to this, as a dull and
languid strain of sentiment. But before we yield
to their censures we would inquire of them what
style they consider, themselves, as most appropriate
to similar subjects in a kindred art. If grave,
simple, sustained melodies&mdash;if tones of deep but
subdued emotion are what our minds naturally
suggest to us upon the mention of sacred <i>music</i>&mdash;why
should there not be something analogous, a kind
of plain chant, in sacred <i>poetry</i> also? fervent, yet
sober; awful, but engaging; neither wild and
passionate, nor light and airy; but such as we may
with submission presume to be the most acceptable
offering in its kind, as being indeed the truest expression
of the best state of the affections. To
many, perhaps to most, men, a tone of more violent
emotion may sound at first more attractive. But
before we <i>indulge</i> such a preference, we should do
well to consider, whether it is quite agreeable to
that spirit, which alone can make us worthy readers
of sacred poetry. &#8216;&#7964;&#957;&#952;&#949;&#959;&#957; &#7973; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#8053;&#963;&#953;&#962;&#8217;, it is true;
there must be rapture and inspiration, but these
will naturally differ in their character as the powers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
do from whom they proceed. The worshippers of
Baal may be rude and frantic in their cries and
gestures; but the true Prophet, speaking to or of
the true <span class="smcap">God</span>, is all dignity and calmness.</p>

<p>If then, in addition to the ordinary difficulties of
poetry, all these things are essential to the success
of the Christian lyrist&mdash;if what he sets before us
must be true in substance, and in manner marked
by a noble simplicity and confidence in that truth, by
a sincere attachment to it, and entire familiarity with
it&mdash;then we need not wonder that so few should have
become eminent in this branch of their art, nor need
we have recourse to the disheartening and unsatisfactory
solutions which are sometimes given of that
circumstance.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8216;Contemplative piety,&#8217; says Dr. Johnson, &#8216;or the intercourse
between God and the human soul, cannot be
poetical. Man, admitted to implore the mercy of his
Creator, and plead the merits of his Redeemer, is already in
a higher state than poetry can confer.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p></div>

<p>The sentiment is not uncommon among serious,
but somewhat fearful, believers; and though we
believe it erroneous, we desire to treat it not only
with tenderness, but with reverence. They start
at the very mention of sacred poetry, as though
poetry were in its essence a profane amusement.
It is, unquestionably, by far the safer extreme to
be too much afraid of venturing with the imagination
upon sacred ground. Yet, if it be an error, and
a practical error, it may be worth while cautiously
to examine the grounds of it. In the generality,
perhaps, it is not so much a deliberate opinion, as
a prejudice against the use of the art, arising out
of its abuse. But the great writer just referred to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>has endeavoured to establish it by direct reasoning.
He argues the point, first, from the nature of poetry,
and afterwards from that of devotion.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The essence of poetry is invention; such invention as,
by producing something unexpected, surprises and delights.
The topics of devotion are few.</p></div>

<p>It is to be hoped that many men&#8217;s experience will
refute the latter part of this statement. How can
the topics of devotion be few, when we are taught to
make every part of life, every scene in nature, an
occasion&mdash;in other words, a topic&mdash;of devotion?
It might as well be said that connubial love is an
unfit subject for poetry, as being incapable of novelty,
because, after all, it is only ringing the changes upon
one simple affection, which every one understands.
The novelty there consists, not in the original topic,
but in continually bringing ordinary things, by happy
strokes of natural ingenuity, into new associations
with the ruling passion.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There&#8217;s not a bonny flower that springs<br /></span>
<span class="i1">By fountain, shaw, or green;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There&#8217;s not a bonnie bird that sings<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But minds me of my Jean.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Why need we fear to extend this most beautiful
and natural sentiment to &#8216;the intercourse between
the human soul and its Maker&#8217;, possessing, as we
do, the very highest warrant for the analogy which
subsists between conjugal and divine love?</p>

<p>Novelty, therefore, sufficient for all the purposes
of poetry, we may have on sacred subjects. Let us
pass to the next objection.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Poetry pleases by exhibiting an idea more grateful to
the mind than things themselves afford. This effect proceeds
from the display of those parts of nature which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
attract, and the concealment of those which repel, the
imagination; but religion must be shown as it is; suppression
and addition equally corrupt it; and, such as it is,
it is known already.</p></div>

<p>A fallacy may be apprehended in both parts of
this statement. There are, surely, real landscapes
which delight the mind as sincerely and intensely
as the most perfect description could; and there are
family groups which give a more exquisite sensation
of domestic happiness than anything in Milton, or
even Shakespeare. It is partly by association with
these, the treasures of the memory, and not altogether
by mere excitement of the imagination, that
Poetry does her work. By the same rule sacred
pictures and sacred songs cannot fail to gratify the
mind which is at all exercised in devotion; recalling,
as they will, whatever of highest perfection in that
way she can remember in herself, or has learned of
others.</p>

<p>Then again, it is not the religious doctrine itself,
so much as the effect of it upon the human mind and
heart, which the sacred poet has to describe. What
is said of suppression and addition may be true
enough with regard to the former, but is evidently
incorrect when applied to the latter: it being an
acknowledged difficulty in all devotional writings,
and not in devotional verse only, to keep clear of
the extreme of languor on the one hand, and debasing
rapture on the other. This requires a delicacy in the
perception and enunciation of truth, of which the
most earnest believer may be altogether destitute.
And since, probably, no man&#8217;s condition, in regard
to eternal things, is exactly like that of any other
man, and yet it is the business of the sacred poet to
sympathize with all, his store of subjects is clearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
inexhaustible, and his powers of discrimination&mdash;in
other words, of suppression and addition&mdash;are kept
in continual exercise.</p>

<p>Nor is he, by any means, so straitly limited in the
other and more difficult branch of his art, the exhibition
of religious doctrine itself, as is supposed in
the following statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Whatever is great, desirable, or tremendous, is comprised
in the name of the Supreme Being. Omnipotence
cannot be exalted; infinity cannot be amplified; perfection
cannot be improved.</p></div>

<p>True: all perfection is implied in the name of
<span class="smcap">God</span>; and so all the beauties and luxuries of spring
are comprised in that one word. But is it not the
very office of poetry to develop and display the
particulars of such complex ideas? in such a way,
for example, as the idea of <span class="smcap">God&#8217;s</span> omnipresence is
developed in the 139th Psalm? and thus detaining
the mind for a while, to force or help her to think
steadily on truths which she would hurry unprofitably
over, how strictly soever they may be implied
in the language which she uses. It is really surprising
that this great and acute critic did not perceive
that the objection applies as strongly against
any kind of composition of which the Divine Nature
is the subject, as against devotional poems.</p>

<p>We forbear to press the consideration that, even if
the objection were allowed in respect of natural
religion, it would not hold against the devotional
compositions of a Christian; the object of whose
worship has condescended also to become the object
of description, affection, and sympathy, in the literal
sense of these words. But this is, perhaps, too
solemn and awful an argument for this place; and
therefore we pass on to the concluding statement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
of the passage under consideration, in which the
writer turns his view downwards, and argues against
sacred poetry from the nature of man, as he had
before from the nature of <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The employments of pious meditation are faith, thanksgiving,
repentance and supplication. Faith, invariably
uniform, cannot be invested by fancy with decorations.
Thanksgiving, the most joyful of all holy effusions, yet
addressed to a Being without passions, is confined to a few
modes, and is to be felt rather than expressed.</p></div>

<p>What we have said of the variation of the devout
affections, as they exist in various persons, is sufficient,
we apprehend, to answer this. But the rest
of the paragraph requires some additional reflection:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Repentance, trembling in the presence of the Judge, is
not at leisure for cadences and epithets.</p></div>

<p>This is rather invidiously put, and looks as if the
author had not entire confidence in the truth of
what he was saying. Indeed, it may very well be
questioned; since many of the more refined passions,
it is certain, naturally express themselves in poetical
language. But repentance is not merely a passion,
nor is its only office to tremble in the presence of the
Judge. So far from it, that one great business of
sacred poetry, as of sacred music, is to quiet and
sober the feelings of the penitent&mdash;to make his compunction
as much of &#8216;a reasonable service&#8217; as
possible.</p>

<p>To proceed:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Supplication of man to man may diffuse itself through
many topics of persuasion: but supplication to God can
only cry for mercy.</p></div>

<p>Certainly, this would be true, if the abstract
nature of the Deity were alone considered. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
if we turn to the sacred volume, which corrects so
many of our erring anticipations, we there find that,
whether in condescension to our infirmities, or for
other wise purposes, we are furnished with inspired
precedents for addressing ourselves to God in all the
various tones, and by all the various topics, which
we should use to a good and wise man standing in the
highest and nearest relation to us. This is so
palpably the case throughout the scriptures, that it
is quite surprising how a person of so much serious
thought as Dr. Johnson could have failed to recollect
it when arguing on the subject of prayer. In
fact, there is a simple test, by which, perhaps, the
whole of his reasoning on Sacred Poetry might be
fairly and decisively tried. Let the reader, as he
goes over it, bear in mind the Psalms of David, and
consider whether every one of his statements and
arguments is not there practically refuted.</p>

<p>It is not, then, because sacred subjects are
peculiarly unapt for poetry, that so few sacred poets
are popular. We have already glanced at some of
the causes to which we attribute it&mdash;we ought to
add another, which strikes us as important. Let us
consider how the case stands with regard to books
of devotion in <i>prose</i>.</p>

<p>We may own it reluctantly, but must it not be
owned? that if two new publications meet the eye
at once, of which no more is known than that the
one is what is familiarly called <i>a good book</i>, the other
a work of mere literature, nine readers out of ten
will take up the second rather than the first? If
this be allowed, whatever accounts for it will contribute
to account also for the comparative failure
of devotional poetry. For this sort of coldness and
languor in the reader must act upon the author in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
more ways than one. The large class who write
for money or applause will of course be carried, by
the tide of popularity, towards some other subject.
Men of more sincere minds, either from true or false
delicacy, will have little heart to expose their retired
thoughts to the risk of mockery or neglect; and if
they do venture, will be checked every moment, like
an eager but bashful musician before a strange
audience, not knowing how far the reader&#8217;s feelings
will harmonize with their own. This leaves the
field open, in a great measure, to harder or more
enthusiastic spirits; who offending continually, in
their several ways, against delicacy, the one by
wildness, the other by coarseness, aggravate the
evil which they wished to cure; till the sacred
subject itself comes at last to bear the blame due to
the indifference of the reader and the indiscretion of
the writer.</p>

<p>Such, we apprehend, would be a probable account
of the condition of sacred poetry, in a country where
religion was coldly acknowledged, and literature
earnestly pursued. How far the description may
apply to England and English literature, in their
various changes since the Reformation&mdash;how far it
may hold true of our own times&mdash;is an inquiry
which would lead us too far at present; but it is
surely worth considering. It goes deeper than any
question of mere literary curiosity. It is a sort of
test of the genuineness of those pretensions, which
many of us are, perhaps, too forward to advance, to
a higher state of morality and piety, as well as
knowledge and refinement, than has been known
elsewhere or in other times.</p>

<p>Those who, in spite of such difficulties, desire in
earnest to do good by the poetical talent, which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
may happen to possess, have only, as it should seem,
the following alternative. Either they must veil,
as it were, the sacredness of the subject&mdash;not
necessarily by allegory, for it may be done in a
thousand other ways&mdash;and so deceive the world
of taste into devotional reading&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Succhi amari intanto ei beve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E dall&#8217; inganno sua vita riceve&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">or else, directly avowing that their subject as well as
purpose is devotion, they must be content with
a smaller number of readers; a disadvantage, however,
compensated by the fairer chance of doing
good to each.</p>

<p>It may be worth while to endeavour to trace this
distinction, as exemplified in the most renowned of
the sacred poets of England; and to glean from
such a survey the best instruction we can, in the
happy art of turning the most fascinating part of
literature to the highest purposes of religion.</p>

<p>We must premise that we limit the title of &#8216;sacred
poet&#8217; by excluding those who only devoted a small
portion of their time and talent now and then, to
sacred subjects. In all ages of our literary history
it seems to have been considered almost as an
essential part of a poet&#8217;s duty to give up some pages
to scriptural story, or to the praise of his Maker,
how remote so ever from anything like religion the
general strain of his writings might be. Witness
the Lamentation of Mary Magdalene in the works
of Chaucer, and the beautiful legend of Hew of
Lincoln, which he has inserted in his Canterbury
Tales; witness also the hymns of Ben Jonson. But
these fragments alone will not entitle their authors
to be enrolled among sacred poets. They indicate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the taste of their age, rather than their own; a fact
which may be thought to stand rather in painful
contrast with the literary history of later days.</p>

<p>There is another class likewise, of whom little
need be said in this place; we mean those who
composed, strictly and only, for the sake of unburthening
their own minds, without any thought of
publication. But as Chaucer&#8217;s sacred effusions
indicate chiefly the character of the times, so poems
such as those we now allude to, mark only the turn
of mind of the individual writers; and our present
business is rather with that sort of poetry which
combines both sorts of instruction; that, namely,
which bears internal evidence of having been written
by sincere men, with an intention of doing good, and
with consideration of the taste of the age in which
they lived.</p>

<p>Recurring then to the distinction above laid down,
between the direct and indirect modes of sacred
poetry; at the head of the two classes, as the reader
may perhaps have anticipated, we set the glorious
names of Spenser and of Milton. The claim of
Spenser to be considered as a sacred poet does by no
means rest upon his hymns alone: although even
those would be enough alone to embalm and consecrate
the whole volume which contains them;
as a splinter of the true cross is supposed by Catholic
sailors to ensure the safety of the vessel. But whoever
will attentively consider the <i>Faerie Queene</i> itself,
will find that it is, almost throughout, such as might
have been expected from the author of those truly
sacred hymns. It is a continual, deliberate endeavour
to enlist the restless intellect and chivalrous feeling
of an inquiring and romantic age, on the side of
goodness and faith, of purity and justice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>This position is to be made good, not solely or
perhaps chiefly, yet with no small force, from the
allegorical structure of the poem. Most of us,
perhaps, are rather disposed to undervalue this
contrivance; and even among the genuine admirers
of Spenser, there are not a few who on purpose leave
it out of their thoughts; finding, as they say, that
it only embarrasses their enjoyment of the poetry.
This is certainly far from reasonable: it is a relic
of childish feeling, and mere love of amusement,
which ill becomes any one who is old enough to
appreciate the real beauties of Spenser. Yet it is so
natural, so obviously to be expected, that we must
suppose a scholar and philosopher (for such Spenser
was, as well as a poet) to have been aware of it, and
to have made up his mind to it, with all its disadvantages,
for some strong reason or other. And
what reason so likely as the hope of being seriously
useful, both to himself and his readers?</p>

<p>To <i>himself</i>, because the constant recurrence to his
allegory would serve as a check upon a fancy otherwise
too luxuriant, and would prevent him from
indulging in such liberties as the Italian poets, in
other respects his worthy masters, were too apt to
take. The consequence is, that even in his freest
passages, and those which one would most wish
unwritten, Spenser is by no means a <i>seductive</i> poet.
Vice in him, however truly described, is always
made contemptible or odious. The same may be
said of Milton and Shakespeare; but Milton was of
a cast of mind originally austere and rigorous. He
looked on vice as a judge; Shakespeare, as a satirist.
Spenser was far more indulgent than either, and acted
therefore the more wisely in setting himself a rule,
which should make it essential to the plan of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
poem to be always recommending some virtue;
and remind him, like a voice from heaven, that the
place on which he was standing was holy ground.</p>

<p>Then as to the benefit which the <i>readers</i> of the
<i>Faerie Queene</i> may derive from its allegorical form;
a good deal surely is to be gained from the mere
habit of looking at things with a view to something
beyond their qualities merely sensible; to their
sacred and moral meaning, and to the high associations
they were intended to create in us. Neither
the works nor the word of God, neither poetry nor
theology, can be duly comprehended without constant
mental exercise of this kind. The comparison
of the Old Testament with the New is nothing else
from beginning to end. And without something
of this sort, poetry, and all the other arts, would
indeed be relaxing to the tone of the mind. The
allegory obviates this ill effect, by serving as a frequent
remembrancer of this higher application.
Not that it is necessary to bend and strain everything
into conformity with it; a little leaven, of
the genuine kind, will go a good way towards
leavening the whole lump. And so it is in the <i>Faerie
Queene</i>; for one stanza of direct allegory there are
perhaps fifty of poetical embellishment; and it is in
these last, after all, that the chief moral excellency
of the poem lies; as we are now about to show.</p>

<p>But to be understood rightly, we would premise,
that there is a disposition,&mdash;the very reverse of that
which leads to parody and caricature,&mdash;which is
common indeed to all generous minds, but is perhaps
unrivalled in Spenser. As parody and caricature
debase what is truly noble, by connecting it with
low and ludicrous associations; so a mind, such as
we are now speaking of, ennobles what of itself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
might seem trivial; its thoughts and language, on
all occasions, taking a uniform and almost involuntary
direction towards the best and highest
things.</p>

<p>This, however, is a subject which can be hardly
comprehended without examples. The first which
occurs to us is the passage which relates the origin
of Belph&#339;be.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her birth was of the womb of morning dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her conception of the joyous prime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all her whole creation did her show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pure and unspotted from all loathly crime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is ingenerate in fleshly slime.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So was this Virgin born, so was she bred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So was she trained up from time to time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all chaste virtue and true bounti-hed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till to her due perfection she was ripen&egrave;d.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is evident how high and sacred a subject was
present to the poet&#8217;s mind in composing this stanza;
and any person who is well read in the Bible, with
a clue like this may satisfy himself that all Spenser&#8217;s
writings are replete with similar tacit allusions to
the language and the doctrines of sacred writ;
allusions breathed, if we may so speak, rather than
uttered, and much fitter to be silently considered,
than to be dragged forward for quotation or minute
criticism. Of course, the more numerous and
natural such allusions are, the more entirely are
we justified in the denomination we have ventured
to bestow on their author, of a truly &#8216;sacred&#8217;
poet.</p>

<p>It may be felt, as some derogation from this high
character, what he has himself avowed&mdash;that much
of his allegory has a turn designedly given it in
honour of Queen Elizabeth; a turn which will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
called courtly or adulatory according to the humour
of the critic. But, in the first place, such was the
custom of the times; it was adopted even in sermons
by men whose sincerity it would be almost sacrilege
to question. Then, the merits of Queen Elizabeth
in respect of the Protestant cause were of that
dazzling order, which might excuse a little poetical
exuberance in her praise. And, what is very deserving
of consideration, it is certain that the most gentle
and generous spirits are commonly found laying
themselves open to this charge of excessive compliment
in addressing princes and patrons. Witness
the high style adopted by the venerable Hooker, in
speaking of this very Queen Elizabeth: &#8216;Whose
sacred power, matched with incomparable goodness
of nature, hath hitherto been God&#8217;s most happy
instrument, by him miraculously kept for works of
so miraculous preservation and safety unto others,&#8217;
&amp;c. Another instance of the same kind may be
seen in Jeremy Taylor&#8217;s dedication of his <i>Worthy
Communicant</i> to the Princess of Orange. Nor is it
any wonder it should be so, since such men feel most
ardently the blessing and benefit as well as the
difficulty of whatever is right in persons of such
exalted station; and are also most strongly tempted
to bear their testimony against the illiberal and
envious censures of the vulgar. All these things,
duly weighed, may seem to leave little, if anything,
in the panegyrical strains of this greatest of laureates,
to be excused by the common infirmity of human
nature; little to detract from our deliberate conviction
that he was seriously guided, in the exercise
of his art, by a sense of duty, and zeal for what is
durably important.</p>

<p>Spenser then was essentially a <i>sacred</i> poet; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the delicacy and insinuating gentleness of his disposition
were better fitted to the veiled than the
direct mode of instruction. His was a mind which
would have shrunk more from the chance of debasing
a sacred subject by unhandsome treatment, than of
incurring ridicule by what would be called unseasonable
attempts to hallow things merely secular. It
was natural therefore for him to choose not a scriptural
story, but a tale of chivalry and romance;
and the popular literature, and, in no small measure,
the pageantry and manners of his time, would join
to attract his efforts that way. In this way too he
was enabled, with more propriety and grace, to
introduce allusions, political or courtly, to subjects
with which his readers were familiar; thus agreeably
diversifying his allegory, and gratifying his
affection for his friends and patrons, without the
coarseness of direct compliment.</p>

<p>In Milton, most evidently, a great difference was
to be expected: both from his own character and
from that of the times in which he lived. Religion
was in those days the favourite topic of discussion;
and it is indeed painful to reflect, how sadly it was
polluted by intermixture with earthly passions:
the most awful turns and most surprising miracles
of the Jewish history being made to serve the base
purposes of persons, of whom it is hard to say
whether they were more successful in misleading
others, or in deceiving themselves. It was an
effort worthy of a manly and devout spirit to rescue
religion from such degradation, by choosing a subject,
which, being scriptural, would suit the habit of
the times, yet, from its universal and eternal importance,
would give least opportunity for debasing
temporary application. Then it was the temper of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the man always to speak out. He carried it to
a faulty excess, as his prose works too amply demonstrate.
The more unfashionable his moral was,
the more he would have disdained to veil it: neither
had he the shrinking delicacy of Spenser to keep him
back, through fear of profaning things hallowed by
an unworthy touch.</p>

<p>Thus the great epic poem of our language came to
be, avowedly, a sacred poem. One hardly dares to
wish any thing other than it is in such a composition;
yet it may be useful to point out in what respects
the moral infirmity of the times, or of the author,
has affected the work; so that we are occasionally
tempted to regret even Milton&#8217;s choice. But as the
leading error of his mind appears to have been
<i>intellectual</i> pride, and as the leading fault of the
generation with which he acted was unquestionably
<i>spiritual</i> pride, so the main defects of his poetry may
probably be attributed to the same causes.</p>

<p>There is a studious undervaluing of the female
character, which may be most distinctly perceived
by comparing the character of Eve with that of the
Lady in Comus: the latter conceived, as we imagine,
before the mind of the poet had become so deeply
tainted with the fault here imputed to him. A remarkable
instance of it is his describing Eve as unwilling,
or unworthy, to discourse herself with the
angel.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Such pleasure she reserved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adam relating; she sole auditress.&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The sentiment may be natural enough, since the
primaeval curse upon women: but does it not argue
rather too strong a sense of her original inferiority,
to put it into her mind before the fall?</p>

<p>What again can be said for the reproachful and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
insulting tone, in which, more than once, the good
angels are made to address the bad ones? or of the
too attractive colours, in which, perhaps unconsciously,
the poet has clothed the Author of Evil
himself? It is a well-known complaint among many
of the readers of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, that they can hardly
keep themselves from sympathizing, in some sort,
with Satan, as the hero of the poem. The most
probable account of which surely is, that the author
himself partook largely of the haughty and vindictive
republican spirit which he has assigned to the
character, and consequently, though perhaps unconsciously,
drew the portrait with a peculiar zest.</p>

<p>These blemishes are in part attributable to the
times in which he lived: but there is another now
to be mentioned, which cannot be so accounted for:
we mean a want of purity and spirituality in his
conceptions of Heaven and heavenly joys. His
Paradise is a vision not to be surpassed; but his
attempts to soar higher are embarrassed with too
much of earth still clinging as it were to his wings.
Remarks of this kind are in general best understood
by comparison, and we invite our readers to compare
Milton with Dante, in their descriptions of Heaven.
The one as simple as possible in his imagery, producing
intense effect by little more than various
combinations of <i>three</i> leading ideas&mdash;light, motion,
and music&mdash;as if he feared to introduce anything
more gross and earthly, and would rather be censured,
as doubtless he often is, for coldness and
poverty of invention. Whereas Milton, with very
little selection or refinement, transfers to the immediate
neighbourhood of God&#8217;s throne the imagery
of Paradise and Earth. Indeed he seems himself to
have been aware of something unsatisfactory in this,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and has inserted into the mouth of an angel, a kind
of apology for it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Though what if earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be but the shadow of heav&#8217;n, and things therein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each to other like, more than on earth is thought?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These are blemishes, and sometimes almost
tempt us to wish that even Milton had taken some
subject not so immediately and avowedly connected
with religion. But they do not affect his claim
to be considered as the very lodestar and pattern of
that class of sacred poets in England. As such
we have here considered him next to Spenser; not
that there were wanting others of the same order
before him. In fact, most of the distinguished
names in the poetical annals of Elizabeth, James I,
and Charles I, might be included in the list. It may
be enough just to recollect Drayton and Cowley,
Herbert, Crashaw and Quarles.</p>

<p>The mention of these latter names suggests the
remark, how very desirable it is to encourage as
indulgent and, if we may so term it, <i>catholic</i> a spirit
as may be, in poetical criticism. From having been
over-praised in their own days, they are come now
to be as much undervalued; yet their quaintness of
manner and constrained imagery, adopted perhaps
in compliance with the taste of their age, should
hardly suffice to overbalance their sterling merits.
We speak especially of Crashaw and Quarles: for
Herbert is a name too venerable to be more than
mentioned in our present discussion.</p>

<p>After Milton, sacred poetry seems to have greatly
declined, both in the number and merit of those who
cultivated it. No other could be expected from the
conflicting evils of those times: in which one party
was used to brand everything sacred with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
name of Puritanism, and the other to suspect every
thing poetical of being contrary to morality and
religion.</p>

<p>Yet most of the great names of that age, especially
among the Romanists, as Dryden, Pope, and before
them Habington, continued to dedicate some of their
poetry to religion. By their faith they were remote
from the controversies which agitated the
established church, and their devotion might indulge
itself without incurring the suspicion of a fanatical
spirit. Then the solemnity of their worship is fitted
to inspire splendid and gorgeous strains, such as
Dryden&#8217;s paraphrase of the Veni Creator; and their
own fallen fortunes in England, no less naturally,
would fill them with a sense of decay very favourable
to the plaintive tenderness of Habington and
Crashaw.</p>

<p>A feeling of this kind, joined to the effect of distressing
languor and sickness, may be discerned,
occasionally, in the writings of Bishop Ken; though
he was far indeed from being a Romanist. We
shall hardly find, in all ecclesiastical history, a greener
spot than the later years of this courageous and
affectionate pastor; persecuted alternately by both
parties, and driven from his station in his declining
age; yet singing on, with unabated cheerfulness, to
the last. His poems are not popular, nor probably
ever will be, for reasons already touched upon; but
whoever in earnest loves his three well-known
hymns, and knows how to value such unaffected
strains of poetical devotion, will find his account, in
turning over his four volumes, half narrative and
half lyric, and all avowedly on sacred subjects; the
narrative often cumbrous, and the lyric verse not
seldom languid and redundant: yet all breathing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
such an angelic spirit, interspersed with such pure
and bright touches of poetry, that such a reader as
we have supposed will scarcely find it in his heart to
criticize them.</p>

<p>Between that time and ours, the form of sacred
poetry which has succeeded best in attracting public
attention, is the didactic: of which Davies in Queen
Elizabeth&#8217;s reign, Sir Richard Blackmore in King
William&#8217;s, Young in the middle, and Cowper in the
close, of the last century, may fairly be taken as
specimens, differing from each other according to
the differences of their respective literary eras.
Davies, with his Lucretian majesty (although he
wants the moral pathos of the Roman poet), representing
aptly enough the age of Elizabeth; Blackmore,
with his easy paragraphs, the careless style of
King Charles&#8217;s days; Young, with his pointed sentences,
transferring to graver subjects a good deal
of the manner of Pope; and Cowper, with his
agreeable but too unsparing descriptions, coming
nearer to the present day, which appears, both
in manners and in scenery, to delight in Dutch
painting, rather than in what is more delicately
classical.</p>

<p>With regard to the indirect, and, perhaps, more
effective, species of sacred poetry, we fear it must
be acknowledged, to the shame of the last century,
that there is hardly a single specimen of it (excepting,
perhaps, Gray&#8217;s Elegy, and possibly some of the
most perfect of Collins&#8217;s poems) which has obtained
any celebrity. We except the writers of our own
times, who do not fall within the scope of this
inquiry.</p>

<p>To Spenser, therefore, upon the whole, the English
reader must revert, as being, pre-eminently, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
sacred poet of his country: as most likely, in every
way, to answer the purposes of his art; especially
in an age of excitation and refinement, in which
the gentler and more homely beauties, both of
character and of scenery, are too apt to be despised:
with passion and interest enough to attract the most
ardent, and grace enough to win the most polished;
yet by a silent preference everywhere inculcating the
love of better and more enduring things; and so most
exactly fulfilling what he has himself declared to
be &#8216;the general end of all his book&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;to fashion a
gentleman, or noble person, in virtuous and gentle
discipline&#8217;: and going the straight way to the
accomplishment of his own high-minded prayer:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That with the glory of so goodly sight,<br /></span>

Criticism of the Grecian Drama. With an original
Treatise on the Principal Tragic and Comic Metres.</i>
Second Edition. Cambridge. 1827.</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> work is well adapted for the purpose it has
in view&mdash;the illustration of the Greek drama.
It has been usual for the young student to engage
in a perusal of this difficult branch of classical
literature, with none of that previous preparation
or collateral assistance which it pre-eminently
requires. Not to mention his ordinary want of
information as regards the history of the drama,
which, though necessary to the full understanding
the nature of that kind of poetry, may still seem
too remotely connected with the existing Greek
plays to be an actual deficiency; nor, again, his
ignorance of the dramatic dialect and metres,
which, without external helps, may possibly be
overcome by minds of superior talent while engaged
upon them; at least without some clear ideas of
the usages of the ancient stage, the Greek dramas
are but partially intelligible. The circumstances
under which the representation was conducted,
the form and general arrangements of the theatre,
the respective offices and disposition of the actors,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the nature and duties of the chorus, the proprieties
of the scene itself, are essential subjects of
information, yet they are generally neglected.
The publication before us is a compilation of
the most useful works or parts of works on the
criticism, history, and antiquities of the drama;
among which will be found extracts from Bentley&#8217;s
<i>Dissertation on the Epistles of Phalaris</i> and from
Schlegel&#8217;s work on Dramatic Literature; the more
important parts of Twining&#8217;s Translation of Aristotle&#8217;s
<i>Poetics</i>, and critical remarks, by Dawes,
Porson, Elmsley, Tate, and the writers in the
<i>Museum Criticum</i>.</p>

<p>If we were disposed to find fault with a useful
work, we should describe it as over-liberal of
condensed critical information. Such ample assistance
is given to the student, that little is left to
exercise his own personal thought and judgement.
This is a fault of not a few publications of the
present day, written for our universities. From
a false estimate of the advantages of accurate
scholarship, the reader is provided with a multitude
of minute facts, which are useful to his mind, not
when barely remembered, but chiefly when he has
acquired them for himself. It is of comparatively
trifling importance, whether the scholar knows the
force of &#959;&#8016; &#956;&#8053; or &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#945; &#947;&#8049;&#961;; but it may considerably
improve his acumen or taste, to have gone through
a process of observation, comparison, and induction,
more or less original and independent of grammarians
and critics. It is an officious aid which
renders the acquisition of a language mechanical.
Commentators are of service to stimulate the
mind, and suggest thought; and though, when
we view the wide field of criticism, it is impossible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
they should do more, yet, when that field is
narrowed to the limit of academical success, there
is a danger of their indulging indolence, or confirming
the contracted views of dullness. These remarks
are not so much directed against a valuable work
like the present, the very perusal of which may be
made an exercise for the mind, as against an
especial fault of the age. The uses of knowledge
in forming the intellectual and moral character,
are too commonly overlooked; and the possession
itself being viewed as a peculiar good, short ways
are on all subjects excogitated for avoiding the
labour of learning; whereas the very length and
process of the journey is in many the chief, in all
an important advantage.</p>

<p>But, dismissing a train of thought which would
soon lead us very far from the range of subjects
which the <i>Theatre of the Greeks</i> introduces to our
notice, we propose to offer some speculations of
our own on Greek tragedy and poetry in general,
founded on the doctrine of Aristotle as contained
in the publication before us. A compilation of
standard works, (and such in its general character
is the <i>Greek Theatre</i>,) scarcely affords the occasion
of lengthened criticism on itself; whereas it may
be of use to the classical student to add some
further illustrations of the subject which is the
common basis of the works compiled.</p>

<p>Aristotle considers the excellence of a tragedy
to depend upon its <i>plot</i>&mdash;and, since a tragedy, as
such, is obviously the exhibition of an <i>action</i>,
no one can deny his statement to be abstractedly
true. Accordingly he directs his principal attention
to the economy of the fable; determines its range
of subjects, delineates its proportions, traces its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
progress from a complication of incidents to their
just and satisfactory arrangement, investigates
the means of making a train of events striking
or affecting, and shows how the exhibition of
character may be made subservient to the purposes
of the action. His treatise is throughout
interesting and valuable. It is one thing, however,
to form the beau id&eacute;al of a tragedy on scientific
principles; another to point out the actual beauty
of a particular school of dramatic composition.
The Greek tragedians are not generally felicitous
in the construction of their plots. Aristotle, then,
rather tells us what tragedy should be, than what
Greek tragedy really was. And this doubtless was
the intention of the philosopher. Since, however,
the Greek drama has obtained so extended and
lasting a celebrity, and yet its excellence does not
fall under the strict rules of the critical art, we
should inquire in what it consists.</p>

<p>That the charm of Greek tragedy does not
ordinarily arise from scientific correctness of plot,
is certain as a matter of fact. Seldom does any
great interest arise from the action; which,
instead of being progressive and sustained, is
commonly either a mere necessary condition of
the drama, or a convenience for the introduction
of matter more important than itself. It is often
stationary&mdash;often irregular&mdash;sometimes either
wants or outlives the catastrophe. In the plays
of Aeschylus it is always simple and inartificial&mdash;in
four out of the seven there is hardly any plot
at all;&mdash;and, though it is of more prominent
importance in those of Sophocles, yet even here
the <i>Oedipus at Colonus</i> is a mere series of incidents,
and the <i>Ajax</i> a union of two separate tales; while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
in the <i>Philoctetes</i>, which is apparently busy, the
circumstances of the action are but slightly
connected with the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>. The carelessness
of Euripides in the construction of his plots is well
known. The action then will be more justly
viewed as the vehicle for introducing the personages
of the drama, than as the principal object of the
poet&#8217;s art; it is not in the plot, but in the
characters, sentiments, and diction, that the
actual merit and poetry of the composition is
placed. To show this to the satisfaction of the
reader, would require a minuter investigation of
details than our present purpose admits; yet
a few instances in point may suggest others to
the memory. E. g. in neither the <i>Oedipus Coloneus</i>
nor the <i>Philoctetes</i>, the two most beautiful plays
of Sophocles, is the plot striking; but how
exquisite is the delineation of the characters of
Antigone and Oedipus, in the former tragedy,
particularly in their interview with Polynices,
and the various descriptions of the scene itself
which the Chorus furnishes! In the <i>Philoctetes</i>,
again, it is the contrast between the worldly
wisdom of Ulysses, the inexperienced frankness
of Neoptolemus, and the simplicity of the afflicted
Philoctetes, which constitutes the principal charm
of the drama. Or we may instance the spirit and
nature displayed in the grouping of the characters
in the <i>Prometheus</i> which is almost without action;&mdash;the
stubborn enemy of the new dynasty of gods;
Oceanus trimming, as an accomplished politician,
with the change of affairs; the single-hearted and
generous Nereids; and Hermes the favourite and
instrument of the usurping potentate. So again,
the beauties of the <i>Thebae</i> are almost independent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
of the plot;&mdash;it is the Chorus which imparts grace
and interest to the actionless scene; and the
speech of Antigone at the end, one of the most
simply striking in any play, has, scientifically
speaking, no place in the tragedy, which should
already have been brought to its conclusion.
Amid the multitude of the beauties of the irregular
Euripides, it is obvious to notice the characters of
Alcestis and the Clytemnestra of the <i>Electra</i>; the
soliloquies of <i>Medea</i>; the picturesque situation
of Ion, the minister of the Pythian temple; the
opening scene of the <i>Orestes</i>; and the dialogues
between Phaedra and her attendant in the
<i>Hippolytus</i>, and the old man and Antigone in
the <i>Phoenissae</i>;&mdash;passages which are either
unconnected with the development of the plot,
or of an importance superior to it. Thus the Greek
drama, as a fact, was modelled on no scientific
principle. It was a pure recreation of the imagination,
revelling without object or meaning beyond
its own exhibition. Gods, heroes, kings, and
dames, enter and retire: they may have a good
reason for appearing&mdash;they may have a very poor
one; whatever it is, still we have no right to ask
for it;&mdash;the question is impertinent. Let us
listen to their harmonious and majestic language&mdash;to
the voices of sorrow, joy, compassion, or
religious emotion&mdash;to the animated odes of the
chorus. Why interrupt so divine a display of
poetical genius by inquiries degrading it to the
level of every-day events, and implying incompleteness
in the action till a catastrophe arrives?
The very spirit of beauty breathes through every
part of the composition. We may liken the Greek
drama to the music of the Italian school; in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the wonder is, how so much richness of invention
in detail can be accommodated to a style so simple
and uniform. Each is the development of grace,
fancy, pathos, and taste, in the respective media
of representation and sound.</p>

<p>However true then it may be, that one or two
of the most celebrated dramas answer to the
requisitions of Aristotle&#8217;s doctrine, still for the
most part, Greek Tragedy has its own distinct
and peculiar praise, which must not be lessened
by a criticism conducted on principles, whether
correct or not, still leading to excellence of another
character. This being, as we hope, shown, we
shall be still bolder, and proceed to question even
the sufficiency of the rules of Aristotle for the
production of dramas of the highest order. These
rules, it would appear, require a plot not merely
natural and unaffected, as a vehicle of more
poetical matter, but one laboured and complicated
as the sole legitimate channel of tragic effect;
and thus tend to withdraw the mind of the poet
from the spontaneous exhibition of pathos or
imagination, to a minute diligence in the formation
of a plan. To explain our views on the subject,
we will institute a short comparison between three
tragedies, the <i>Agamemnon</i>, the <i>Oedipus</i>, and the
<i>Bacchae</i>, one of each of the tragic poets, where,
by reference to Aristotle&#8217;s principles, we think it
will be found that the most perfect in plot is not
the most poetical.</p>

<p>Of these the action of the <i>Oedipus Tyrannus</i> is
frequently instanced by the critic as a specimen
of judgement and skill in the selection and
combination of the incidents; and in this point
of view it is truly a masterly composition. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
clearness, precision, certainty, and vigour, with
which the line of the action moves on to its
termination, is admirable. The character of
Oedipus too is finely drawn, and identified with
the development of the action.</p>

<p>The <i>Agamemnon</i> of Aeschylus presents us with
the slow and difficult birth of a portentous secret&mdash;an
event of old written in the resolves of destiny,
a crime long meditated in the bosom of the human
agents. The Chorus here has an importance
altogether wanting in the Chorus of the <i>Oedipus</i>.
They throw a pall of ancestral honour over the
bier of the hereditary monarch, which would have
been unbecoming in the case of the upstart king
of Thebes. Till the arrival of Agamemnon, they
occupy our attention, as the prophetic organ, not
commissioned indeed but employed by heaven,
to proclaim the impending horrors. Succeeding
to the brief intimation of the watcher who opens
the play, they seem oppressed with forebodings
of woe and crime which they can neither justify
nor analyse. The expression of their anxiety
forms the stream in which the plot flows&mdash;every
thing, even news of joy, takes a colouring from
the depth of their gloom. On the arrival of the
king, they retire before Cassandra, a more regularly
commissioned prophetess; who, speaking first in
figure, then in plain terms, only ceases that we
may hear the voice of the betrayed monarch
himself, informing us of the striking of the fatal
blow. Here then the very simplicity of the fable
constitutes its especial beauty. The death of
Agamemnon is intimated at first&mdash;it is accomplished
at last: throughout we find but the growing in
volume and intensity of one and the same note&mdash;it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
is a working up of one musical ground, by
fugue and imitation, into the richness of combined
harmony. But we look in vain for the
progressive and thickening incidents of the
<i>Oedipus</i>.</p>

<p>The action of the <i>Bacchae</i> is also simple. It is
the history of the reception of the worship of
Bacchus in Thebes; who, first depriving Pentheus
of his reason, and thereby drawing him on to his
ruin, establishes his divinity. The interest of the
scene arises from the gradual process by which the
derangement of the Theban king is effected, which
is powerfully and originally described. It would
be comic, were it unconnected with religion. As it
is, it exhibits the grave irony of a god triumphing
over the impotent presumption of man, the sport
and terrible mischievousness of an insulted deity.
It is an exemplification of the adage, <i>quem deus
vult perdere, prius dementat</i>. So delicately balanced
is the action along the verge of the sublime and
grotesque, that it is both solemn and humorous,
without violence to the propriety of the composition:
the mad and merry fire of the Chorus, the imbecile
mirth of old Cadmus and Tiresias, and the infatuation
of Pentheus, who is ultimately induced to
dress himself in female garb to gain admittance
among the Bacchae, are made to harmonize with
the terrible catastrophe which concludes the life
of the intruder. Perhaps the victim&#8217;s first discovery
of the disguised deity is the finest conception in
this splendid drama. His madness enables him to
discern the emblematic horns on the head of
Bacchus, which were hid from him when in his
sound mind; yet this discovery, instead of leading
him to an acknowledgement of the divinity, provides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
him only with matter for a stupid and perplexed
astonishment.</p>

</div></div>

<p class="noin">This play is on the whole the most favourable
specimen of the genius of Euripides&mdash;not breathing
the sweet composure, the melodious fullness, the
majesty and grace of Sophocles; nor rudely and
overpoweringly tragic as Aeschylus; but brilliant,
versatile, imaginative, as well as deeply pathetic.</p>

<p>Here then are two dramas of extreme poetical
power, but deficient in skilfulness of plot. Are
they on that account to be rated below the <i>Oedipus</i>,
which, in spite of its many beauties, has not even
a share of the richness and sublimity of either?</p>

<p>Aristotle, then, it must be allowed, treats
dramatic composition more as an exhibition of
ingenious workmanship, than as a free and
unfettered effusion of genius. The inferior poem
may, on his principle, be the better tragedy. He
may indeed have intended solely to delineate the
outward framework most suitable to the reception
of the spirit of poetry, not to discuss the nature
of poetry itself. If so, it cannot be denied that,
the poetry being given equal in the two cases,
the more perfect plot will merit the greater share
of praise. And it may seem to agree with this
view of his meaning, that he pronounces Euripides,
in spite of the irregularity of his plots, to be, after
all, the most tragic of the Greek dramatists,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>inasmuch (i. e.) as he excels in his appeal to those
passions which the outward form of the drama
merely subserves. Still there is surely too much
stress laid by the philosopher upon the artificial
part; which, after all, leads to negative, more
than to positive excellence; and should rather be
the natural and (so to say) unintentional result of
the poet&#8217;s feeling and imagination, than be
separated from them as the direct object of his
care. Perhaps it is hardly fair to judge of Aristotle&#8217;s
sentiments by the fragment of his work which has
come down to us. Yet as his natural taste led
him to delight in the explication of systems, and
in those large and connected views which his
vigorous talent for thinking through subjects
supplied, we may be allowed to suspect him of
entertaining too cold and formal conceptions of
the nature of poetical composition, as if its beauties
were less subtle and delicate than they really are.
A word has power to convey a world of information
to the imagination, and to act as a spell upon the
feelings: there is no need of sustained fiction&mdash;often
no room for it.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Some confirmation of the judgement
we have ventured to pass on the greatest of
analytical philosophers, is the account he gives of
the source of poetical pleasure; which he almost
identifies with a gratification of the reasoning
faculty, placing it in the satisfaction derived from
recognizing in fiction a resemblance to the realities
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>of life&mdash;&#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#945;&#8055;&#957;&#949;&#953; &#952;&#949;&#969;&#961;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#962; &#956;&#945;&#957;&#952;&#8049;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#963;&#965;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#8055;&#950;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;, &#964;&#8055; &#7957;&#954;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957;.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>But as we have treated, rather unceremoniously,
a deservedly high authority, we will try to
compensate for our rudeness, by illustrating his
general doctrine of the nature of poetry, which
we hold to be most true and philosophical.</p>

<p>Poetry, according to Aristotle, is a representation
of the ideal. Biography and history represent
individual characters and actual facts; poetry, on
the contrary, generalizing from the phenomena of
nature and life, supplies us with pictures drawn
not after an existing pattern, but after a creation
of the mind. <i>Fidelity</i> is the primary merit of
biography and history; the essence of poetry is
<i>fiction</i>. <i>Poesis nihil aliud est</i> (says Bacon) <i>quam
historiae imitatio ad placitum</i>. It delineates that
perfection which the imagination suggests, and to
which as a limit the present system of divine
Providence actually tends. Moreover, by confining
the attention to one series of events and scene of
action, it bounds and finishes off the confused
luxuriance of real nature; while, by a skilful
adjustment of circumstances, it brings into sight
the connexion of cause and effect, completes the
dependence of the parts one on another, and harmonizes
the proportions of the whole. It is then
but the type and model of history or biography, if
we may be allowed the comparison, bearing some
resemblance to the abstract mathematical formula
of physics, before it is modified by the contingencies
of gravity and friction. Hence, while it
recreates the imagination by the superhuman loveliness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>of its views, it provides a solace for the mind
broken by the disappointments and sufferings of
actual life; and becomes, moreover, the utterance of
the inward emotions of a right moral feeling, seeking
a purity and a truth which this world will not give.</p>

<p>It follows that the poetical mind is one full of
the eternal forms of beauty and perfection; these
are its material of thought, its instrument and
medium of observation&mdash;these colour each object
to which it directs its view. It is called imaginative
or creative, from the originality and independence
of its modes of thinking, compared with the
common-place and matter-of-fact conceptions of
ordinary minds, which are fettered down to the
particular and individual. At the same time it
feels a natural sympathy with everything great and
splendid in the physical and moral world; and selecting
such from the mass of common phenomena,
incorporates them, as it were, into the substance of
its own creations. From living thus in a world of
its own, it speaks the language of dignity, emotion,
and refinement. Figure is its necessary medium
of communication with man; for in the feebleness
of ordinary words to express its ideas, and in the
absence of terms of abstract perfection, the
adoption of metaphorical language is the only
poor means allowed it for imparting to others
its intense feelings. A metrical garb has, in all
languages, been appropriated to poetry&mdash;it is but
the outward development of the music and
harmony within. The verse, far from being
a restraint on the true poet, is the suitable index
of his sense, and is adopted by his free and
deliberate choice.</p>

<p>We shall presently show the applicability of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
doctrine to the various departments of poetical
composition; first, however, it will be right to
volunteer an explanation which may save it from
much misconception and objection. Let not our
notion be thought arbitrarily to limit the number
of poets, generally considered such. It will be
found to lower particular works, or parts of works,
rather than the writers themselves; sometimes to
condemn only the vehicle in which the poetry is
conveyed. There is an ambiguity in the word
poetry, which is taken to signify both the talent
itself, and the written composition which is the
result of it. Thus there is an apparent, but no
real contradiction, in saying a poem may be but
partially poetical; in some passages more so than
in others; and sometimes not poetical at all.
We only maintain&mdash;not that writers forfeit the
name of poet who fail at times to answer to our
requisitions, but&mdash;that they are poets only so far
forth and inasmuch as they do answer to them.
We may grant, for instance, that the vulgarities
of old Phoenix in the ninth <i>Iliad</i>, or of the nurse
of Orestes in the <i>Choephoroe</i>, or perhaps of
the grave-diggers in <i>Hamlet</i>, are in themselves
unworthy of their respective authors, and refer
them to the wantonness of exuberant genius; and
yet maintain that the scenes in question contain
much <i>incidental</i> poetry. Now and then the lustre
of the true metal catches the eye, redeeming
whatever is unseemly and worthless in the rude
ore; still the ore is not the metal. Nay sometimes,
and not unfrequently in Shakespeare, the introduction
of unpoetical matter may be necessary for
the sake of relief, or as a vivid expression of
recondite conceptions, and (as it were) to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
friends with the reader&#8217;s imagination. This
necessity, however, cannot make the additions
in themselves beautiful and pleasing. Sometimes,
on the other hand, while we do not deny the
incidental beauty of a poem, we are ashamed and
indignant on witnessing the unworthy substance
in which that beauty is imbedded. This remark
applies strongly to the immoral compositions to
which Lord Byron devoted his last years. Now
to proceed with our proposed investigation.</p>

<p>We will notice <i>descriptive poetry</i> first. Empedocles
wrote his physics in verse, and Oppian his history
of animals. Neither were poets&mdash;the one was an
historian of nature, the other a sort of biographer
of brutes. Yet a poet may make natural history
or philosophy the material of his composition.
But under his hands they are no longer a bare
collection of facts or principles, but are painted
with a meaning, beauty, and harmonious order not
their own. Thomson has sometimes been commended
for the novelty and minuteness of his
remarks upon nature. This is not the praise of
a poet; whose office rather is to represent <i>known</i>
phenomena in a new connexion or medium. In
<i>L&#8217;Allegro</i> and <i>Il Penseroso</i> the poetical magician
invests the commonest scenes of a country life with
the hues, first of a mirthful, then of a pensive mind.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
Pastoral poetry is a description of rustics, agriculture,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>and cattle, softened off and corrected from the
rude health of nature. Virgil, and much more Pope
and others, have run into the fault of colouring
too highly;&mdash;instead of drawing generalized and
ideal forms of <i>shepherds</i>, they have given us pictures
of <i>gentlemen</i> and <i>beaux</i>. Their composition may
be poetry, but it is not pastoral poetry.</p>

<p>The difference between poetical and historical
<i>narrative</i> may be illustrated by the &#8216;Tales Founded
on Facts&#8217;, generally of a religious character, so
common in the present day, which we must not be
thought to approve, because we use them for our
purpose. The author finds in the circumstances
of the case many particulars too trivial for public
notice, or irrelevant to the main story, or partaking
perhaps too much of the peculiarity of individual
minds:&mdash;these he omits. He finds connected
events separated from each other by time or place,
or a course of action distributed among a multitude
of agents; he limits the scene or duration of the tale,
and dispenses with his host of characters by condensing
the mass of incident and action in the history
of a few. He compresses long controversies into
a concise argument&mdash;and exhibits characters by
dialogue&mdash;and (if such be his object) brings
prominently forward the course of Divine Providence
by a fit disposition of his materials. Thus he
selects, combines, refines, colours&mdash;in fact, <i>poetizes</i>.
His facts are no longer <i>actual</i> but <i>ideal</i>&mdash;a tale
<i>founded on</i> facts is a tale <i>generalized from</i> facts.
The authors of <i>Peveril of the Peak</i>, and of <i>Brambletye
House</i>, have given us their respective
descriptions of the profligate times of Charles II.
Both accounts are interesting, but for different
reasons. That of the latter writer has the fidelity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
of history; Walter Scott&#8217;s picture is the hideous
reality unintentionally softened and decorated by
the poetry of his own mind. Miss Edgeworth sometimes
apologizes for certain incidents in her tales, by
stating they took place &#8216;by one of those strange
chances which occur in life, but seem incredible
when found in writing&#8217;. Such an excuse evinces
a misconception of the principle of fiction, which,
being the <i>perfection</i> of the actual, prohibits the
introduction of any such anomalies of experience.
It is by a similar impropriety that painters
sometimes introduce unusual sunsets, or other
singular phenomena of lights and forms. Yet
some of Miss Edgeworth&#8217;s works contain much
poetry of narrative. <i>Man&#339;uvring</i> is perfect in
its way&mdash;the plot and characters are natural,
without being too real to be pleasing.</p>

<p><i>Character</i> is made poetical by a like process.
The writer draws indeed from experience; but
unnatural peculiarities are laid aside, and harsh
contrasts reconciled. If it be said, the fidelity of
the imitation is often its greatest merit, we have
only to reply, that in such cases the pleasure is
not poetical, but consists in the mere recognition.
All novels and tales which introduce real characters,
are in the same degree unpoetical. Portrait-painting,
to be poetical, should furnish an abstract
representation of an individual; the abstraction
being more rigid, inasmuch as the painting is
confined to one point of time. The artist should
draw independently of the accidents of attitude,
dress, occasional feeling, and transient action.
He should depict the general spirit of his subject&mdash;as
if he were copying from memory, not from
a few particular sittings. An ordinary painter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
will delineate with rigid fidelity, and will make
a caricature. But the learned artist contrives so
to temper his composition, as to sink all offensive
peculiarities and hardnesses of individuality, without
diminishing the striking effect of the likeness, or
acquainting the casual spectator with the secret of
his art. Miss Edgeworth&#8217;s representations of the
Irish character are actual, and not poetical&mdash;nor
were they intended to be so. They are interesting,
because they are faithful. If there is poetry about
them, it exists in the personages themselves, not
in her representation of them. She is only the
accurate reporter in word of what was poetical in
fact. Hence, moreover, when a deed or incident
is striking in itself, a judicious writer is led to
describe it in the most simple and colourless terms,
his own being unnecessary; e. g. if the greatness
of the action itself excites the imagination, or the
depth of the suffering interests the feelings. In the
usual phrase, the circumstances are left to &#8216;speak for
themselves&#8217;.</p>

<p>Let it not be said that our doctrine is adverse to
that individuality in the delineation of character,
which is a principal charm of fiction. It is not
necessary for the ideality of a composition to avoid
those minuter shades of difference between man and
man, which give to poetry its plausibility and life;
but merely such violation of general nature, such
improbabilities, wanderings, or coarsenesses, as
interfere with the refined and delicate enjoyment
of the imagination; which would have the elements
of beauty extracted out of the confused multitude
of ordinary actions and habits, and combined with
consistency and ease. Nor does it exclude the
introduction of imperfect or odious characters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
The original conception of a weak or guilty mind
may have its intrinsic beauty. And much more so,
when it is connected with a tale which finally adjusts
whatever is reprehensible in the personages themselves.
Richard and Iago are subservient to the plot.
Moral excellence of character may sometimes be
even a fault. The Clytemnestra of Euripides is so
interesting, that the divine vengeance, which is the
main subject of the drama, seems almost unjust.
Lady Macbeth, on the contrary, is the conception
of one deeply learned in the poetical art. She is
polluted with the most heinous crimes, and meets
the fate she deserves. Yet there is nothing in the
picture to offend the taste, and much to feed the
imagination. Romeo and Juliet are too good for
the termination to which the plot leads&mdash;so are
Ophelia and the bride of Lammermoor. In these
cases there is something inconsistent with correct
beauty, and therefore unpoetical. We do not say
the fault could be avoided without sacrificing more
than would be gained; still it is a fault. It is
scarcely possible for a poet satisfactorily to connect
innocence with ultimate unhappiness, when the
notion of a future life is excluded. Honours paid
to the memory of the dead are some alleviation of
the harshness. In his use of the doctrine of a future
life, Southey is admirable. Other writers are content
to conduct their heroes to temporal happiness&mdash;Southey
refuses present comfort to his Ladurlad,
Thalaba, and Roderick, but carries them on through
suffering to another world. The death of his hero
is the termination of the action; yet so little in two
of them, at least, does this catastrophe excite
sorrowful feelings, that some readers may be
startled to be reminded of the fact. If a melancholy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
is thrown over the conclusion of the <i>Roderick</i>, it is
from the peculiarities of the hero&#8217;s previous history.</p>

<p>Opinions, feelings, manners, and customs, are
made poetical by the delicacy or splendour with
which they are expressed. This is seen in the <i>ode</i>,
<i>elegy</i>, <i>sonnet</i>, and <i>ballad</i>; in which a single idea
perhaps, or familiar occurrence, is invested by the
poet with pathos or dignity. The ballad of <i>Old
Robin Gray</i> will serve, for an instance, out of
a multitude; again, Lord Byron&#8217;s <i>Hebrew Melody</i>,
beginning &#8216;Were my bosom as false&#8217;, &amp;c.; or
Cowper&#8217;s <i>Lines on his Mother&#8217;s Picture</i>; or Milman&#8217;s
&#8216;Funeral Hymn&#8217; in the <i>Martyr of Antioch</i>;
or Milton&#8217;s <i>Sonnet on his Blindness</i>; or Bernard
Barton&#8217;s <i>Dream</i>. As picturesque specimens, we
may name Campbell&#8217;s <i>Battle of the Baltic</i>; or
Joanna Baillie&#8217;s <i>Chough and Crow</i>; and for the
more exalted and splendid style, Gray&#8217;s <i>Bard</i>; or
Milton&#8217;s <i>Hymn on the Nativity</i>; in which facts,
with which every one is familiar, are made new by
the colouring of a poetical imagination. It must
all along be observed, that we are not adducing
instances for their own sake; but in order to
illustrate our general doctrine, and to show its
applicability to those compositions which are, by
universal consent, acknowledged to be poetical.</p>

<p>The department of poetry we are now speaking
of, is of much wider extent than might at first sight
appear. It will include such moralizing and
philosophical poems as Young&#8217;s <i>Night Thoughts</i>,
and Byron&#8217;s <i>Childe Harold</i>.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> There is much bad
taste, at present, in the judgement passed on
compositions of this kind. It is the fault of the day
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>to mistake mere eloquence for poetry; whereas, in
direct opposition to the conciseness and simplicity
of the poet, the talent of the orator consists in
making much of a single idea. &#8216;<i>Sic dicet ille ut
verset saepe multis modis eandem et unam rem, ut
haereat in eadem commoreturque sententia.</i>&#8217; This is
the great art of Cicero himself, who, whether he is
engaged in statement, argument, or raillery, never
ceases till he has exhausted the subject; going
round about it, and placing it in every different
light, yet without repetition to offend or weary the
reader. This faculty seems to consist in the power
of throwing off harmonious sentences, which, while
they have a respectable proportion of meaning,
yet are especially intended to charm the ear. In
popular poems, common ideas are unfolded with
copiousness, and set off in polished verse&mdash;and this
is called poetry. In the <i>Pleasures of Hope</i> we find
this done with exquisite taste; but it is in his
minor poems that the author&#8217;s powerful and free
poetical genius rises to its natural elevation. In
<i>Childe Harold</i>, too, the writer is carried through his
Spenserian stanza with the unweariness and equable
fullness of accomplished eloquence; opening,
illustrating, and heightening one idea, before he
passes on to another. His composition is an
extended funeral oration over buried joys and
pleasures. His laments over Greece, Rome, and
the fallen in various engagements, have quite the
character of panegyrical orations; while by the
very attempt to describe the celebrated buildings
and sculptures of antiquity, he seems to confess that
<i>they</i> are the poetical text, his the rhetorical comment.
Still it is a work of splendid talent, though,
as a whole, not of the highest poetical excellence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Juvenal is, perhaps, the only ancient author who
habitually substitutes declamation for poetry.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The <i>philosophy of mind</i> may equally be made
subservient to poetry, as the philosophy of nature.
It is a common fault to mistake a mere knowledge
of the heart for poetical talent. Our greatest
masters have known better;&mdash;they have subjected
metaphysics to their art. In <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Macbeth</i>,
<i>Richard</i>, and <i>Othello</i>, the philosophy of mind is but
the material of the poet. These personages are
ideal; they are effects of the contact of a given
internal character with given outward circumstances,
the results of combined conditions determining (so
to say) a moral curve of original and inimitable
properties. Philosophy is exhibited in the same
subserviency to poetry in many parts of Crabbe&#8217;s
<i>Tales of the Hall</i>. In the writings of this author
there is much to offend a refined taste; but at
least in the work in question there is much of
a highly poetical cast. It is a representation of
the action and re-action of two minds upon each
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>other and upon the world around them. Two
brothers of different characters and fortunes, and
strangers to each other, meet. Their habits of
mind, the formation of those habits by external
circumstances, their respective media of judgement,
their points of mutual attraction and repulsion,
the mental position of each in relation to a variety
of trifling phenomena of every-day nature and life,
are beautifully developed in a series of tales moulded
into a connected narrative. We are tempted to
single out the fourth book, which gives an account
of the childhood and education of the younger
brother, and which for variety of thought as well
as fidelity of description is in our judgement beyond
praise. The Waverley novels would afford us
specimens of a similar excellence. One striking
peculiarity of these tales is the author&#8217;s practice of
describing a group of characters bearing the same
general features of mind, and placed in the same
general circumstances; yet so contrasted with each
other in minute differences of mental constitution,
that each diverges from the common starting-place
into a path peculiar to himself. The brotherhood of
villains in <i>Kenilworth</i>, of knights in <i>Ivanhoe</i>, and of
enthusiasts in <i>Old Mortality</i> are instances of this.
This bearing of character and plot on each other is
not often found in Byron&#8217;s poems. The Corsair is
intended for a remarkable personage. We pass by
the inconsistencies of his character, considered by
itself. The grand fault is that, whether it be natural
or not, we are obliged to accept the author&#8217;s word for
the fidelity of his portrait. We are told, not shown,
what the hero was. There is nothing in the plot
which results from his peculiar formation of mind.
An every-day bravo might equally well have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
satisfied the requirements of the action. Childe
Harold, again, if he is any thing, is a being professedly
isolated from the world, and uninfluenced by it.
One might as well draw Tityrus&#8217;s stags grazing in
the air, as a character of this kind; which yet,
with more or less alteration, passes through successive
editions in his other poems. Byron had very little
versatility or elasticity of genius; he did not know
how to make poetry out of existing materials.
He declaims in his own way, and has the upper hand
as long as he is allowed to go on; but, if interrogated
on principles of nature and good sense, he is at once
put out and brought to a stand. Yet his conception
of Sardanapalus and Myrrha is fine and ideal, and
in the style of excellence which we have just been
admiring in Shakespeare and Scott.</p>

<p>These illustrations of Aristotle&#8217;s doctrine may
suffice.</p>

<p>Now let us proceed to a fresh position; which,
as before, shall first be broadly stated, then modified
and explained. How does originality differ from the
poetical talent? Without affecting the accuracy of
a definition, we may call the latter the originality of
right moral feeling.</p>

<p>Originality may perhaps be defined as the power
of abstracting for oneself, and is in thought what
strength of mind is in action. Our opinions are
commonly derived from education and society.
Common minds transmit as they receive, good and
bad, true and false; minds of original talent feel
a continual propensity to investigate subjects and
strike out views for themselves;&mdash;so that even old
and established truths do not escape modification
and accidental change when subjected to this
process of mental digestion. Even the style of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
original writers is stamped with the peculiarities
of their minds. When originality is found apart
from good sense, which more or less is frequently
the case, it shows itself in paradox and rashness of
sentiment, and eccentricity of outward conduct.
Poetry, on the other hand, cannot be separated from
its good sense, or taste, as it is called; which is one
of its elements. It is originality energizing in the
world of beauty; the originality of grace, purity,
refinement, and feeling. We do not hesitate to say,
that poetry is ultimately founded on correct moral
perception;&mdash;that where there is no sound principle
in exercise there will be no poetry, and that on the
whole (originality being granted) in proportion to
the standard of a writer&#8217;s moral character, will his
compositions vary in poetical excellence. This
position, however, requires some explanation.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Of course, then, we do not mean to imply that
a poet must necessarily <i>display</i> virtuous and religious
feeling;&mdash;we are not speaking of the actual <i>material</i>
of poetry, but of its <i>sources</i>. A right moral state of
heart is the formal and scientific condition of
a poetical mind. Nor does it follow from our
position that every poet must in fact be a man of
consistent and practical principle; except so far as
good feeling commonly produces or results from
good practice. Burns was a man of inconsistent
practice&mdash;still, it is known, of much really sound
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>principle at bottom. Thus his acknowledged
poetical talent is in no wise inconsistent with the
truth of our doctrine, which will refer the beauty
which exists in his compositions to the remains of
a virtuous and diviner nature within him. Nay,
further than this, our theory holds good even though
it be shown that a bad man may write a poem. As
motives short of the purest lead to actions intrinsically
good, so frames of mind short of virtuous will
produce a partial and limited poetry. But even
where it is exhibited, the poetry of a vicious mind
will be inconsistent and debased; i. e. so far only
such, as the traces and shadows of holy truth still
remain upon it. On the other hand, a right moral
feeling places the mind in the very centre of that
circle from which all the rays have their origin and
range; whereas minds otherwise placed command
but a portion of the whole circuit of poetry. Allowing
for human infirmity and the varieties of opinion,
Milton, Spenser, Cowper, Wordsworth, and Southey,
may be considered, as far as their writings go, to
approximate to this moral centre. The following
are added as further illustrations of our meaning.
Walter Scott&#8217;s centre is chivalrous honour; Shakespeare
exhibits the &#7974;&#952;&#959;&#962;], the physiognomy of an
unlearned and undisciplined piety; Homer the
religion of nature and the heart, at times debased
by polytheism. All these poets are religious:&mdash;the
occasional irreligion of Virgil&#8217;s poetry is painful
to the admirers of his general taste and delicacy.
Dryden&#8217;s <i>Alexander&#8217;s Feast</i> is a magnificent composition,
and has high poetical beauties; but to
a delicate judgement there is something intrinsically
unpoetical in the end to which it is devoted, the
praises of revel and sensuality. It corresponds to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
a process of clever reasoning erected on an untrue
foundation&mdash;the one is a fallacy, the other is out
of taste. Lord Byron&#8217;s <i>Manfred</i> is in parts intensely
poetical; yet the refined mind naturally shrinks
from the spirit which here and there reveals itself,
and the basis on which the fable is built. From
a perusal of it we should infer, according to the above
theory, that there was right and fine feeling in the
poet&#8217;s mind, but that the central and consistent
character was wanting. From the history of his
life we know this to be the fact. The connexion
between want of the religious principle and want of
poetical feeling, is seen in the instances of Hume
and Gibbon; who had radically unpoetical minds.
Rousseau is not an exception to our doctrine, for
his heart was naturally religious. Lucretius too
had much poetical talent; but his work evinces
that his miserable philosophy was rather the result
of a bewildered judgement than a corrupt heart.</p>

<p>According to the above theory, revealed religion
should be especially poetical&mdash;and it is so in fact.
While its disclosures have an originality in them to
engage the intellect, they have a beauty to satisfy
the moral nature. It presents us with those ideal
forms of excellence in which a poetical mind delights,
and with which all grace and harmony are associated.
It brings us into a new world&mdash;a world of overpowering
interest, of the sublimest views, and the tenderest
and purest feelings. The peculiar grace of mind of
the New Testament writers is as striking as the
actual effect produced upon the hearts of those
who have imbibed their spirit. At present we are
not concerned with the practical, but the poetical
nature of revealed truth. With Christians a poetical
view of things is a duty&mdash;we are bid to colour all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
things with hues of faith, to see a divine meaning
in every event, and a superhuman tendency. Even
our friends around are invested with unearthly
brightness&mdash;no longer imperfect men, but beings
taken into divine favour, stamped with his seal,
and in training for future happiness. It may be
added that the virtues peculiarly Christian are
especially poetical;&mdash;meekness, gentleness, compassion,
contentment, modesty, not to mention
the devotional virtues: whereas the ruder and
more ordinary feelings are the instruments of
rhetoric more justly than of poetry&mdash;anger, indignation,
emulation, martial spirit, and love of
independence.</p>

<p>A few remarks on poetical composition, and we
have done.&mdash;The art of composition is merely
accessory to the poetical talent. But where that
talent exists it necessarily gives its own character
to the style, and renders it perfectly different from
all others. As the poet&#8217;s habits of mind lead to
contemplation rather than communication with
others, he is more or less obscure, according to the
particular style of poetry he has adopted; less so,
in epic or narrative and dramatic representation&mdash;more
so, in odes and choruses. He will be obscure,
moreover, from the depth of his feelings, which
require a congenial reader to enter into them&mdash;and
from their acuteness, which shrinks from any
formal accuracy in the expression of them. And he
will be obscure, not only from the carelessness of
genius and from the originality of his conceptions,
but (it may be) from natural deficiency in the
power of clear and eloquent expression, which, we
must repeat, is a talent distinct from poetry, though
often mistaken for it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>Dexterity in composition, or <i>eloquence</i> as it may
be called in a contracted sense of the word, is
however manifestly more or less necessary in every
branch of literature, though its elements may be
different in each. <i>Poetical</i> eloquence consists, first
in the power of illustration&mdash;which the poet uses,
not as the orator, voluntarily, for the sake of
clearness or ornament; but almost by constraint,
as the sole outlet and expression of intense inward
feeling. The spontaneous power of comparison is
in some poetical minds entirely wanting; these of
course cannot show to advantage as poets.&mdash;Another
talent necessary to composition is the
power of unfolding the meaning in an orderly
manner. A poetical mind is often too impatient to
explain itself justly; it is overpowered by a rush
of emotions, which sometimes want of power,
sometimes the indolence of inward enjoyment
prevents it from describing. Nothing is more
difficult than to analyse the feelings of our own
minds; and the power of doing so, whether natural
or acquired, is clearly distinct from experiencing
them. Yet, though distinct from the poetical talent,
it is obviously necessary to its exhibition. Hence
it is a common praise bestowed upon writers, that
they express what we have often felt but could
never describe. The power of arrangement, which
is necessary for an extended poem, is a modification
of the same talent;&mdash;being to poetry what method
is to logic. Besides these qualifications, poetical
compositions requires that command of language
which is the mere effect of practice. The poet is
a compositor; words are his types; he must have
them within reach, and in unlimited abundance.
Hence the need of careful labour to the accomplished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
poet&mdash;not in order that his diction may attract,
but that language may be subjected to him. He
studies the art of composition as we might learn
dancing or elocution; not that we may move or
speak according to rule, but that by the very
exercise our voice and carriage may become so
unembarrassed as to allow of our doing what we
will with them.</p>

<p>A talent for composition then is no essential part
of poetry, though indispensable to its exhibition.
Hence it would seem that attention to the language
<i>for its own sake</i> evidences not the true poet but the
mere artist. Pope is said to have tuned our tongue.
We certainly owe much to him&mdash;his diction is rich,
musical, and expressive. Still he is not on this
account a poet; he elaborated his composition
for its own sake. If we give him poetical praise on
this account, we may as appropriately bestow it on
a tasteful cabinet-maker. This does not forbid us
to ascribe the grace of his verse to an inward
principle of poetry, which supplied him with
archetypes of the beautiful and splendid to work by.
But a similar internal gift must direct the skill of
every fancy-artist who subserves the luxuries and
elegancies of life. On the other hand, though Virgil
is celebrated as a master of composition, yet his
style is so identified with his conceptions, as their
outward development, as to preclude the possibility
of our viewing the one apart from the other. In
Milton, again, the harmony of the verse is but the
echo of the inward music which the thoughts of
the poet breathe. In Moore&#8217;s style the ornament
continually outstrips the sense. Cowper and
Walter Scott, on the other hand, are slovenly in
their versification. Sophocles writes, on the whole,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
without studied attention to the style; but
Euripides frequently affects a simplicity and
prettiness which exposed him to the ridicule of the
comic poets. Lastly, the style of Homer&#8217;s poems is
perfect in their particular department. It is free,
manly, simple, perspicuous, energetic, and varied.
It is the style of one who rhapsodized without
deference to hearer or judge, in an age prior to the
temptations which more or less prevailed over
succeeding writers&mdash;before the theatre had degraded
poetry into an exhibition, and criticism narrowed
it into an art.</p>

<h3>1795-1881</h3>

<h3>THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE<br />
(1840)</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Hero as Divinity, the Hero as Prophet, are
productions of old ages; not to be repeated in the
new. They presuppose a certain rudeness of conception,
which the progress of mere scientific knowledge
puts an end to. There needs to be, as it were,
a world vacant, or almost vacant of scientific forms,
if men in their loving wonder are to fancy their
fellow-man either a god or one speaking with the
voice of a god. Divinity and Prophet are past.
We are now to see our Hero in the less ambitious,
but also less questionable, character of Poet; a
character which does not pass. The Poet is
a heroic figure belonging to all ages; whom all
ages possess, when once he is produced, whom the
newest age as the oldest may produce;&mdash;and will
produce, always when Nature pleases. Let Nature
send a Hero-soul; in no age is it other than possible
that he may be shaped into a Poet.</p>

<p>Hero, Prophet, Poet,&mdash;many different names, in
different times and places, do we give to Great
Men; according to varieties we note in them,
according to the sphere in which they have displayed
themselves! We might give many more
names, on this same principle. I will remark again,
however, as a fact not unimportant to be understood,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
that the different <i>sphere</i> constitutes the
grand origin of such distinction; that the Hero
can be Poet, Prophet, King, Priest or what you
will, according to the kind of world he finds himself
born into. I confess, I have no notion of a
truly great man that could not be <i>all</i> sorts of men.
The Poet who could merely sit on a chair, and compose
stanzas, would never make a stanza worth
much. He could not sing the Heroic warrior, unless
he himself were at least a Heroic warrior too.
I fancy there is in him the Politician, the Thinker,
Legislator, Philosopher;&mdash;in one or the other
degree, he could have been, he is all these. So too
I cannot understand how a Mirabeau, with that
great glowing heart, with the fire that was in it,
with the bursting tears that were in it, could not
have written verses, tragedies, poems, and touched
all hearts in that way, had his course of life and
education led him thitherward. The grand fundamental
character is that of Great Man; that the
man be great. Napoleon has words in him which
are like Austerlitz Battles. Louis Fourteenth&#8217;s
Marshals are a kind of poetical men withal; the
things Turenne says are full of sagacity and
geniality, like sayings of Samuel Johnson. The
great heart, the clear deep-seeing eye: there it
lies; no man whatever, in what province soever,
can prosper at all without these. Petrarch and
Boccaccio did diplomatic messages, it seems, quite
well: one can easily believe it; they had done
things a little harder than these! Burns, a gifted
song-writer, might have made a still better
Mirabeau. Shakespeare,&mdash;one knows not what
<i>he</i> could not have made, in the supreme degree.</p>

<p>True, there are aptitudes of Nature too. Nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
does not make all great men, more than all other
men, in the self-same mould. Varieties of aptitude
doubtless; but infinitely more of circumstance;
and far oftenest it is the <i>latter</i> only that are looked
to. But it is as with common men in the learning
of trades. You take any man, as yet a vague
capability of a man, who could be any kind of
craftsman; and make him into a smith, a carpenter,
a mason: he is then and thenceforth that
and nothing else. And if, as Addison complains,
you sometimes see a street-porter staggering under
his load on spindle-shanks, and near at hand a
tailor with the frame of a Samson handling a bit
of cloth and small Whitechapel needle,&mdash;it cannot
be considered that aptitude of Nature alone has been
consulted here either!&mdash;The Great Man also, to
what shall he be bound apprentice? Given your
Hero, is he to become Conqueror, King, Philosopher,
Poet? It is an inexplicably complex controversial-calculation
between the world and him!
He will read the world and its laws; the world
with its laws will be there to be read. What the
world, on <i>this</i> matter, shall permit and bid is, as
we said, the most important fact about the world.&mdash;</p>


<p class="newsection">Poet and Prophet differ greatly in our loose
modern notions of them. In some old languages,
again, the titles are synonymous; <i>Vates</i> means
both Prophet and Poet: and indeed at all times,
Prophet and Poet, well understood, have much
kindred of meaning. Fundamentally indeed they
are still the same; in this most important respect
especially, That they have penetrated both of
them into the sacred mystery of the Universe;
what Goethe calls &#8216;the open secret&#8217;. &#8216;Which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
the great secret?&#8217; asks one.&mdash;&#8216;The <i>open</i> secret,&#8217;&mdash;open
to all, seen by almost none! That divine
mystery, which lies everywhere in all Beings, &#8216;the
Divine Idea of the World, that which lies at the
bottom of Appearance,&#8217; as Fichte styles it; of
which all Appearance, from the starry sky to the
grass of the field, but especially the Appearance
of Man and his work, is but the <i>vesture</i>, the embodiment
that renders it visible. This divine mystery
<i>is</i> in all times and in all places; veritably is. In
most times and places it is greatly overlooked;
and the Universe, definable always in one or the
other dialect, as the realized Thought of God, is
considered a trivial, inert, commonplace matter,&mdash;as
if, says the Satirist, it were a dead thing, which
some upholsterer had put together! It could do
no good, at present, to <i>speak</i> much about this; but
it is a pity for every one of us if we do not know it,
live ever in the knowledge of it. Really a most
mournful pity;&mdash;a failure to live at all, if we live
otherwise!</p>

<p>But now, I say, whoever may forget this divine
mystery, the <i>Vates</i>, whether Prophet or Poet, has
penetrated into it; is a man sent hither to make it
more impressively known to us. That always is his
message; he is to reveal that to us,&mdash;that sacred
mystery which he more than others lives ever
present with. While others forget it, he knows it;&mdash;I
might say, he has been driven to know it;
without consent asked of <i>him</i>, he finds himself
living in it, bound to live in it. Once more, here
is no Hearsay, but a direct Insight and Belief; this
man too could not help being a sincere man! Whosoever
may live in the shows of things, it is for him
a necessity of nature to live in the very fact of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
things. A man, once more, in earnest with the
Universe, though all others were but toying with
it. He is a <i>Vates</i>, first of all, in virtue of being
sincere. So far Poet and Prophet, participators in
the &#8216;open secret,&#8217; are one.</p>

<p>With respect to their distinction again: The
<i>Vates</i> Prophet, we might say, has seized that sacred
mystery rather on the moral side, as Good and Evil,
Duty and Prohibition; the <i>Vates</i> Poet on what
the Germans call the &aelig;sthetic side, as Beautiful,
and the like. The one we may call a revealer of
what we are to do, the other of what we are to love.
But indeed these two provinces run into one
another, and cannot be disjoined. The Prophet
too has his eye on what we are to love: how else
shall he know what it is we are to do? The highest
Voice ever heard on this Earth said withal, &#8216;Consider
the lilies of the field; they toil not, neither
do they spin: yet Solomon in all his glory was not
arrayed like one of these.&#8217; A glance, that, into the
deepest deep of Beauty. &#8216;The lilies of the field,&#8217;&mdash;dressed
finer than earthly princes, springing up
there in the humble furrow-field; a beautiful <i>eye</i>
looking out on you, from the great inner Sea of
Beauty! How could the rude Earth make these,
if her Essence, rugged as she looks and is, were not
inwardly Beauty?&mdash;In this point of view, too, a
saying of Goethe&#8217;s, which has staggered several,
may have meaning: &#8216;The Beautiful&#8217;, he intimates,
&#8216;is higher than the Good; the Beautiful includes
in it the Good.&#8217; The <i>true</i> Beautiful; which however,
I have said somewhere, &#8216;differs from the
<i>false</i>, as Heaven does from Vauxhall!&#8217; So much
for the distinction and identity of Poet and
Prophet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>In ancient and also in modern periods, we find
a few Poets who are accounted perfect; whom it
were a kind of treason to find fault with. This is
noteworthy; this is right: yet in strictness it is
only an illusion. At bottom, clearly enough, there
is no perfect Poet! A vein of Poetry exists in the
hearts of all men; no man is made altogether of
Poetry. We are all poets when we <i>read</i> a poem
well. The &#8216;imagination that shudders at the Hell
of Dante,&#8217; is not that the same faculty, weaker in
degree, as Dante&#8217;s own? No one but Shakespeare
can embody, out of Saxo Grammaticus, the story
of <i>Hamlet</i> as Shakespeare did: but every one models
some kind of story out of it; every one embodies
it better or worse. We need not spend time in
defining. Where there is no specific difference, as
between round and square, all definition must be
more or less arbitrary. A man that has <i>so</i> much
more of the poetic element developed in him as to
have become noticeable, will be called Poet by his
neighbours. World-Poets too, those whom we are
to take for perfect Poets, are settled by critics in
the same way. One who rises <i>so</i> far above the
general level of Poets will, to such and such critics,
seem a Universal Poet; as he ought to do. And
yet it is, and must be, an arbitrary distinction.
All Poets, all men, have some touches of the Universal;
no man is wholly made of that. Most
Poets are very soon forgotten: but not the noblest
Shakespeare or Homer of them can be remembered
<i>for ever</i>;&mdash;a day comes when he too is not!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, you will say, there must be a
difference between true Poetry and true Speech not
Poetical: what is the difference? On this point
many things have been written, especially by late<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
German Critics, some of which are not very intelligible
at first. They say, for example, that the
Poet has an <i>infinitude</i> in him; communicates an
<i>Unendlichkeit</i>, a certain character of &#8216;infinitude&#8217;,
to whatsoever he delineates. This, though not
very precise, yet on so vague a matter is worth
remembering: if well meditated, some meaning
will gradually be found in it. For my own part,
I find considerable meaning in the old vulgar distinction
of Poetry being <i>metrical</i>, having music in
it, being a Song. Truly, if pressed to give a definition,
one might say this as soon as anything else:
If your delineation be authentically <i>musical</i>, musical
not in word only, but in heart and substance, in all
the thoughts and utterances of it, in the whole
conception of it, then it will be poetical; if not,
not.&mdash;Musical: how much lies in that! A <i>musical</i>
thought is one spoken by a mind that has penetrated
into the inmost heart of the thing; detected
the inmost mystery of it, namely the <i>melody</i> that
lies hidden in it; the inward harmony of coherence
which is its soul, whereby it exists, and has a right
to be, here in this world. All inmost things, we
may say, are melodious; naturally utter themselves
in Song. The meaning of Song goes deep.
Who is there that, in logical words, can express the
effect music has on us? A kind of inarticulate
unfathomable speech, which leads us to the edge
of the Infinite, and lets us for moments gaze into
that!</p>

<p>Nay all speech, even the commonest speech, has
something of song in it: not a parish in the world
but has its parish-accent;&mdash;the rhythm or <i>tune</i>
to which the people there <i>sing</i> what they have to
say! Accent is a kind of chanting; all men have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
accent of their own,&mdash;though they only <i>notice</i> that
of others. Observe too how all passionate language
does of itself become musical,&mdash;with a finer music
than the mere accent; the speech of a man even
in zealous anger becomes a chant, a song. All deep
things are Song. It seems somehow the very central
essence of us, Song; as if all the rest were but
wrappages and hulls! The primal element of us;
of us, and of all things. The Greeks fabled of
Sphere-Harmonies: it was the feeling they had
of the inner structure of Nature; that the soul of
all her voices and utterances was perfect music.
Poetry, therefore, we will call <i>musical Thought</i>.
The Poet is he who <i>thinks</i> in that manner. At
bottom, it turns still on power of intellect; it is
a man&#8217;s sincerity and depth of vision that makes
him a Poet. See deep enough, and you see musically;
the heart of Nature <i>being</i> everywhere music,
if you can only reach it.</p>

<p>The <i>Vates</i> Poet, with his melodious Apocalypse
of Nature, seems to hold a poor rank among us, in
comparison with the <i>Vates</i> Prophet; his function,
and our esteem of him for his function, alike slight.
The Hero taken as Divinity; the Hero taken as
Prophet; then next the Hero taken only as Poet:
does it not look as if our estimate of the Great Man,
epoch after epoch, were continually diminishing?
We take him first for a god, then for one god-inspired;
and now in the next stage of it, his most
miraculous word gains from us only the recognition
that he is a Poet, beautiful verse-maker,
man of genius, or such-like!&mdash;It looks so; but I
persuade myself that intrinsically it is not so. If
we consider well, it will perhaps appear that in
man still there is the <i>same</i> altogether peculiar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
admiration for the Heroic Gift, by what name
soever called, that there at any time was.</p>

<p>I should say, if we do not now reckon a Great
Man literally divine, it is that our notions of God,
of the supreme unattainable Fountain of Splendour,
Wisdom and Heroism, are ever rising <i>higher</i>; not
altogether that our reverence for these qualities,
as manifested in our like, is getting lower. This is
worth taking thought of. Sceptical Dilettantism,
the curse of these ages, a curse which will not last
for ever, does indeed in this the highest province
of human things, as in all provinces, make sad
work; and our reverence for great men, all crippled,
blinded, paralytic as it is, comes out in poor plight,
hardly recognizable. Men worship the shows of
great men; the most disbelieve that there is any
reality of great men to worship. The dreariest,
fatallest faith; believing which, one would literally
despair of human things. Nevertheless look,
for example, at Napoleon! A Corsican lieutenant
of artillery; that is the show of <i>him</i>: yet is he
not obeyed, <i>worshipped</i> after his sort, as all the
Tiaraed and Diademed of the world put together
could not be? High Duchesses, and ostlers of
inns, gather round the Scottish rustic, Burns;&mdash;a
strange feeling dwelling in each that they never
heard a man like this; that, on the whole, this is
the man! In the secret heart of these people it
still dimly reveals itself, though there is no accredited
way of uttering it at present, that this
rustic, with his black brows and flashing sun-eyes,
and strange words moving laughter and tears, is
of a dignity far beyond all others, incommensurable
with all others. Do not we feel it so? But now,
were Dilettantism, Scepticism, Triviality, and all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
that sorrowful brood, cast-out of us,&mdash;as, by God&#8217;s
blessing, they shall one day be; were faith in the
shows of things entirely swept out, replaced by
clear faith in the <i>things</i>, so that a man acted on
the impulse of that only, and counted the other
non-extant; what a new livelier feeling towards
this Burns were it!</p>

<p>Nay here in these ages, such as they are, have
we not two mere Poets, if not deified, yet we may
say beatified? Shakespeare and Dante are Saints
of Poetry; really, if we will think of it, <i>canonized</i>,
so that it is impiety to meddle with them. The
unguided instinct of the world, working across all
these perverse impediments, has arrived at such
result. Dante and Shakespeare are a peculiar Two.
They dwell apart, in a kind of royal solitude; none
equal, none second to them: in the general feeling
of the world, a certain transcendentalism, a glory
as of complete perfection, invests these two. They
<i>are</i> canonized, though no Pope or Cardinals took
hand in doing it! Such, in spite of every perverting
influence, in the most unheroic times, is still
our indestructible reverence for heroism.&mdash;We will
look a little at these Two, the Poet Dante and the
Poet Shakespeare: what little it is permitted us
to say here of the Hero as Poet will most fitly
arrange itself in that fashion.</p>


<p class="newsection">Many volumes have been written by way of commentary
on Dante and his Book; yet, on the whole,
with no great result. His Biography is, as it were,
irrecoverably lost for us. An unimportant, wandering,
sorrowstricken man, not much note was
taken of him while he lived; and the most of that
has vanished, in the long space that now intervenes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
It is five centuries since he ceased writing
and living here. After all commentaries, the Book
itself is mainly what we know of him. The Book;&mdash;and
one might add that Portrait commonly attributed
to Giotto, which, looking on it, you cannot
help inclining to think genuine, whoever did it.
To me it is a most touching face; perhaps of all
faces that I know, the most so. Lonely there,
painted as on vacancy, with the simple laurel
wound round it; the deathless sorrow and pain,
the known victory which is also deathless;&mdash;significant
of the whole history of Dante! I think it
is the mournfullest face that ever was painted from
reality; an altogether tragic, heart-affecting face.
There is in it, as foundation of it, the softness, tenderness,
gentle affection as of a child; but all this
is as if congealed into sharp contradiction, into
abnegation, isolation, proud hopeless pain. A soft
ethereal soul looking out so stern, implacable,
grim-trenchant, as from imprisonment of thick-ribbed
ice! Withal it is a silent pain too, a silent
scornful one: the lip is curled in a kind of god-like
disdain of the thing that is eating-out his heart,&mdash;as
if it were withal a mean insignificant thing, as
if he whom it had power to torture and strangle
were greater than it. The face of one wholly in
protest, and lifelong unsurrendering battle, against
the world. Affection all converted into indignation:
an implacable indignation; slow, equable, silent,
like that of a god! The eye too, it looks out as in
a kind of <i>surprise</i>, a kind of inquiry, Why the world
was of such a sort? This is Dante: so he looks,
this &#8216;voice of ten silent centuries&#8217;, and sings us
&#8216;his mystic unfathomable song&#8217;.</p>

<p>The little that we know of Dante&#8217;s Life corresponds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
well enough with this Portrait and this
Book. He was born at Florence, in the upper class
of society, in the year 1265. His education was
the best then going; much school-divinity, Aristotelean
logic, some Latin classics,&mdash;no inconsiderable
insight into certain provinces of things:
and Dante, with his earnest intelligent nature, we
need not doubt, learned better than most all
that was learnable. He has a clear cultivated
understanding, and of great subtlety; this best
fruit of education he had contrived to realize from
these scholastics. He knows accurately and well
what lies close to him; but, in such a time, without
printed books or free intercourse, he could not
know well what was distant: the small clear light,
most luminous for what is near, breaks itself into
singular <i>chiaroscuro</i> striking on what is far off.
This was Dante&#8217;s learning from the schools. In
life, he had gone through the usual destinies; been
twice out campaigning as a soldier for the Florentine
State, been on embassy; had in his thirty-fifth
year, by natural gradation of talent and service,
become one of the Chief Magistrates of Florence.
He had met in boyhood a certain Beatrice Portinari,
a beautiful little girl of his own age and rank, and
grown-up thenceforth in partial sight of her, in
some distant intercourse with her. All readers
know his graceful affecting account of this; and
then of their being parted; of her being wedded
to another, and of her death soon after. She makes
a great figure in Dante&#8217;s Poem; seems to have made
a great figure in his life. Of all beings it might
seem as if she, held apart from him, far apart at
last in the dim Eternity, were the only one he had
ever with his whole strength of affection loved.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
She died: Dante himself was wedded; but it
seems not happily, far from happily. I fancy, the
rigorous earnest man, with his keen excitabilities,
was not altogether easy to make happy.</p>

<p>We will not complain of Dante&#8217;s miseries: had
all gone right with him as he wished it, he might
have been Prior, Podest&agrave;, or whatsoever they call
it, of Florence, well accepted among neighbours,&mdash;and
the world had wanted one of the most notable
words ever spoken or sung. Florence would have
had another prosperous Lord Mayor; and the ten
dumb centuries continued voiceless, and the ten
other listening centuries (for there will be ten of
them and more) had no <i>Divina Commedia</i> to hear!
We will complain of nothing. A nobler destiny
was appointed for this Dante; and he, struggling
like a man led towards death and crucifixion, could
not help fulfilling it. Give <i>him</i> the choice of his
happiness! He knew not, more than we do, what
was really happy, what was really miserable.</p>

<p>In Dante&#8217;s Priorship, the Guelf-Ghibelline,
Bianchi-Neri, or some other confused disturbances
rose to such a height, that Dante, whose party had
seemed the stronger, was with his friends cast
unexpectedly forth into banishment; doomed
thenceforth to a life of woe and wandering. His
property was all confiscated and more; he had
the fiercest feeling that it was entirely unjust,
nefarious in the sight of God and man. He tried
what was in him to get reinstated; tried even by
warlike surprisal, with arms in his hand: but it
would not do; bad only had become worse. There
is a record, I believe, still extant in the Florence
Archives, dooming this Dante, wheresoever caught,
to be burnt alive. Burnt alive; so it stands, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
say: a very curious civic document. Another
curious document, some considerable number of
years later, is a Letter of Dante&#8217;s to the Florentine
Magistrates, written in answer to a milder proposal
of theirs, that he should return on condition of
apologizing and paying a fine. He answers, with
fixed stern pride: &#8216;If I cannot return without
calling myself guilty, I will never return, <i>nunquam
revertar</i>.&#8217;</p>

<p>For Dante there was now no home in this world.
He wandered from patron to patron, from place
to place; proving, in his own bitter words, &#8216;How
hard is the path, <i>Come &egrave; duro calle</i>.&#8217; The wretched
are not cheerful company. Dante, poor and
banished, with his proud earnest nature, with his
moody humours, was not a man to conciliate men.
Petrarch reports of him that being at Can della
Scala&#8217;s court, and blamed one day for his gloom
and taciturnity, he answered in no courtier-like
way. Della Scala stood among his courtiers, with
mimes and buffoons (<i>nebulones ac histriones</i>) making
him heartily merry; when turning to Dante, he
said: &#8216;Is it not strange, now, that this poor fool
should make himself so entertaining; while you,
a wise man, sit there day after day, and have
nothing to amuse us with at all?&#8217; Dante answered
bitterly: &#8216;No, not strange; your Highness is to
recollect the Proverb, <i>Like to Like</i>;&#8217;&mdash;given the
amuser, the amusee must also be given! Such a
man, with his proud silent ways, with his sarcasms
and sorrows, was not made to succeed at court.
By degrees, it came to be evident to him that he
had no longer any resting-place, or hope of benefit,
in this earth. The earthly world had cast him
forth, to wander, wander; no living heart to love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
him now; for his sore miseries there was no solace
here.</p>

<p>The deeper naturally would the Eternal World
impress itself on him; that awful reality over
which, after all, this Time-world, with its Florences
and banishments, only flutters as an unreal shadow.
Florence thou shalt never see: but Hell and Purgatory
and Heaven thou shalt surely see! What
is Florence, Can della Scala, and the World and
Life altogether? <span class="smcap">Eternity</span>: thither, of a truth,
not elsewhither, art thou and all things bound!
The great soul of Dante, homeless on earth, made
its home more and more in that awful other world.
Naturally his thoughts brooded on that, as on the
one fact important for him. Bodied or bodiless, it
is the one fact important for all men:&mdash;but to Dante,
in that age, it was bodied in fixed certainty of scientific
shape; he no more doubted of that <i>Malebolge</i>
Pool, that it all lay there with its gloomy circles,
with its <i>alti guai</i>, and that he himself should see it,
than we doubt that we should see Constantinople
if we went thither. Dante&#8217;s heart, long filled with
this, brooding over it in speechless thought and awe,
bursts forth at length into &#8216;mystic unfathomable
song&#8217;; and this his <i>Divine Comedy</i>, the most
remarkable of all modern Books, is the result.</p>

<p>It must have been a great solacement to Dante,
and was, as we can see, a proud thought for him at
times, That he, here in exile, could do this work;
that no Florence, nor no man or men, could hinder
him from doing it, or even much help him in doing
it. He knew too, partly, that it was great; the
greatest a man could do. &#8216;If thou follow thy star,
<i>Se tu segui tua stella</i>,&#8217;&mdash;so could the Hero, in his
forsakenness, in his extreme need, still say to himself:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
&#8216;Follow thou thy star, thou shalt not fail of
a glorious heaven!&#8217; The labour of writing, we find,
and indeed could know otherwise, was great and
painful for him; he says, This Book, &#8216;which has
made me lean for many years.&#8217; Ah yes, it was won,
all of it, with pain and sore toil,&mdash;not in sport, but
in grim earnest. His Book, as indeed most good
Books are, has been written, in many senses, with
his heart&#8217;s blood. It is his whole history, this Book.
He died after finishing it; not yet very old, at the
age of fifty-six;&mdash;broken-hearted rather, as is said.
He lies buried in his death-city Ravenna: <i>Hic
claudor Dantes patriis extorris ab oris</i>. The Florentines
begged back his body, in a century after; the
Ravenna people would not give it. &#8216;Here am I
Dante laid, shut out from my native shores.&#8217;</p>


<p class="newsection">I said, Dante&#8217;s Poem was a Song: it is Tieck who
calls it &#8216;a mystic unfathomable Song&#8217;; and such
is literally the character of it. Coleridge remarks
very pertinently somewhere, that wherever you find
a sentence musically worded, of true rhythm and
melody in the words, there is something deep and
good in the meaning too. For body and soul, word
and idea, go strangely together here as everywhere.
Song: we said before, it was the Heroic of Speech!
All <i>old</i> Poems, Homer&#8217;s and the rest, are authentically
Songs. I would say, in strictness, that all
right Poems are; that whatsoever is not <i>sung</i> is
properly no Poem, but a piece of Prose cramped
into jingling lines,&mdash;to the great injury of the grammar,
to the great grief of the reader, for most part!
What we want to get at is the <i>thought</i> the man
had, if he had any: why should he twist it into
jingle, if he <i>could</i> speak it out plainly? It is only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
when the heart of him is rapt into true passion of
melody, and the very tones of him, according to
Coleridge&#8217;s remark, become musical by the greatness,
depth and music of his thoughts, that we can
give him right to rhyme and sing; that we call him
a Poet, and listen to him as the Heroic of Speakers,&mdash;whose
speech <i>is</i> Song. Pretenders to this are
many; and to an earnest reader, I doubt, it is for
most part a very melancholy, not to say an insupportable
business, that of reading rhyme! Rhyme
that had no inward necessity to be rhymed;&mdash;it
ought to have told us plainly, without any jingle,
what it was aiming at. I would advise all men who
<i>can</i> speak their thought, not to sing it; to understand
that, in a serious time, among serious men,
there is no vocation in them for singing it. Precisely
as we love the true song, and are charmed by
it as by something divine, so shall we hate the false
song, and account it a mere wooden noise, a thing
hollow, superfluous, altogether an insincere and
offensive thing.</p>

<p>I give Dante my highest praise when I say of his
<i>Divine Comedy</i> that it is, in all senses, genuinely a
Song. In the very sound of it there is a <i>canto fermo</i>;
it proceeds as by a chant. The language, his simple
<i>terza rima</i>, doubtless helped him in this. One reads
along naturally with a sort of <i>lilt</i>. But I add, that
it could not be otherwise; for the essence and
material of the work are themselves rhythmic. Its
depth, and rapt passion and sincerity, makes it
musical;&mdash;go <i>deep</i> enough, there is music everywhere.
A true inward symmetry, what one calls
an architectural harmony, reigns in it, proportionates
it all: architectural; which also partakes
of the character of music. The three kingdoms,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
<i>Inferno</i>, <i>Purgatorio</i>, <i>Paradiso</i>, look out on one
another like compartments of a great edifice; a
great supernatural world-cathedral, piled up there,
stern, solemn, awful; Dante&#8217;s World of Souls! It
is, at bottom, the <i>sincerest</i> of all Poems; sincerity,
here too, we find to be the measure of worth. It
came deep out of the author&#8217;s heart of hearts; and
it goes deep, and through long generations, into ours.
The people of Verona, when they saw him on the
streets, used to say, &#8216;<i>Eccovi l&#8217; uom ch&#8217; &egrave; stato all&#8217;
Inferno</i>, See, there is the man that was in Hell!&#8217;
Ah, yes, he had been in Hell;&mdash;in Hell enough, in
long severe sorrow and struggle; as the like of him
is pretty sure to have been. Commedias that come-out
<i>divine</i> are not accomplished otherwise. Thought,
true labour of any kind, highest virtue itself, is it
not the daughter of Pain? Born as out of the black
whirlwind;&mdash;true <i>effort</i>, in fact, as of a captive
struggling to free himself: that is Thought. In all
ways we are &#8216;to become perfect through <i>suffering</i>.&#8217;&mdash;But,
as I say, no work known to me is so elaborated
as this of Dante&#8217;s. It has all been as if molten,
in the hottest furnace of his soul. It had made him
&#8216;lean&#8217; for many years. Not the general whole only;
every compartment of it is worked-out, with intense
earnestness, into truth, into clear visuality. Each
answers to the other; each fits in its place, like
a marble stone accurately hewn and polished. It
is the soul of Dante, and in this the soul of the
Middle Ages, rendered for ever rhythmically visible
there. No light task; a right intense one: but
a task which is <i>done</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps one would say, <i>intensity</i>, with the much
that depends on it, is the prevailing character of
Dante&#8217;s genius. Dante does not come before us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
as a large catholic mind; rather as a narrow, and
even sectarian mind: it is partly the fruit of his
age and position, but partly too of his own nature.
His greatness has, in all senses, concentered itself
into fiery emphasis and depth. He is world-great
not because he is world-wide, but because he is
world-deep. Through all objects he pierces as it
were down into the heart of Being. I know nothing
so intense as Dante. Consider, for example, to
begin with the outermost development of his intensity,
consider how he paints. He has a great power
of vision; seizes the very type of a thing; presents
that and nothing more. You remember that first
view he gets of the Hall of Dite: <i>red</i> pinnacle, red-hot
cone of iron glowing through the dim immensity
of gloom;&mdash;so vivid, so distinct, visible at once and
for ever! It is as an emblem of the whole genius of
Dante. There is a brevity, an abrupt precision in
him: Tacitus is not briefer, more condensed; and
then in Dante it seems a natural condensation,
spontaneous to the man. One smiting word; and
then there is silence, nothing more said. His silence
is more eloquent than words. It is strange with
what a sharp decisive grace he snatches the true
likeness of a matter: cuts into the matter as with
a pen of fire. Plutus, the blustering giant, collapses
at Virgil&#8217;s rebuke; it is &#8216;as the sails sink, the mast
being suddenly broken&#8217;. Or that poor Sordello,
with the <i>cotto aspetto</i>, &#8216;face <i>baked</i>&#8217;, parched brown
and lean; and the &#8216;fiery snow&#8217; that falls on them
there, a &#8216;fiery snow without wind&#8217;, slow, deliberate,
never-ending! Or the lids of those Tombs; square
sarcophaguses, in that silent dim-burning Hall, each
with its Soul in torment; the lids laid open there;
they are to be shut at the Day of Judgement,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
through Eternity. And how Farinata rises; and
how Cavalcante falls&mdash;at hearing of his Son, and
the past tense &#8216;<i>fue</i>!&#8217; The very movements in
Dante have something brief; swift, decisive, almost
military. It is of the inmost essence of his genius
this sort of painting. The fiery, swift Italian nature
of the man, so silent, passionate, with its quick
abrupt movements, its silent &#8216;pale rages&#8217;, speaks
itself in these things.</p>

<p>For though this of painting is one of the outermost
developments of a man, it comes like all else from
the essential faculty of him; it is physiognomical
of the whole man. Find a man whose words paint
you a likeness, you have found a man worth something;
mark his manner of doing it, as very characteristic
of him. In the first place, he could not have
discerned the object at all, or seen the vital type
of it, unless he had, what we may call, <i>sympathized</i>
with it,&mdash;had sympathy in him to bestow on objects.
He must have been <i>sincere</i> about it too; sincere
and sympathetic: a man without worth cannot
give you the likeness of any object; he dwells in
vague outwardness, fallacy and trivial hearsay,
about all objects. And indeed may we not say that
intellect altogether expresses itself in this power
of discerning what an object is? Whatsoever of
faculty a man&#8217;s mind may have will come out here.
Is it even of business, a matter to be done? The
gifted man is he who <i>sees</i> the essential point, and
leaves all the rest aside as surplusage: it is his
faculty too, the man of business&#8217;s faculty, that he
discern the true <i>likeness</i>, not the false superficial
one, of the thing he has got to work in. And how
much of <i>morality</i> is in the kind of insight we get
of anything; &#8216;the eye seeing in all things what it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
brought with it the faculty of seeing!&#8217; To the
mean eye all things are trivial, as certainly as to the
jaundiced they are yellow. Raphael, the Painters
tell us, is the best of all Portrait-painters withal.
No most gifted eye can exhaust the significance of
any object. In the commonest human face there
lies more than Raphael will take away with him.</p>

<p>Dante&#8217;s painting is not graphic only, brief, true,
and of a vividness as of fire in dark night; taken on
the wider scale, it is everyway noble, and the outcome
of a great soul. Francesca and her Lover,
what qualities in that! A thing woven as out of
rainbows, on a ground of eternal black. A small
flute-voice of infinite wail speaks there, into our
very heart of hearts. A touch of womanhood in it
too: <i>della bella persona, che mi fu tolta</i>; and how,
even in the Pit of woe, it is a solace that <i>he</i> will
never part from her! Saddest tragedy in these
<i>alti guai</i>. And the racking winds, in that <i>aer bruno</i>,
whirl them away again, to wail for ever!&mdash;Strange
to think: Dante was the friend of this poor Francesca&#8217;s
father; Francesca herself may have sat upon
the Poet&#8217;s knee, as a bright innocent little child.
Infinite pity, yet also infinite rigour of law: it is
so Nature is made; it is so Dante discerned that
she was made. What a paltry notion is that of his
<i>Divine Comedy&#8217;s</i> being a poor splenetic impotent
terrestrial libel; putting those into Hell whom he
could not be avenged upon on earth! I suppose if
ever pity, tender as a mother&#8217;s, was in the heart
of any man, it was in Dante&#8217;s. But a man who does
not know rigour cannot pity either. His very pity
will be cowardly, egoistic,&mdash;sentimentality, or little
better. I know not in the world an affection equal
to that of Dante. It is a tenderness, a trembling,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
longing, pitying love: like the wail of Aeolean harps,
soft, soft; like a child&#8217;s young heart;&mdash;and then
that stern, sore-saddened heart! These longings
of his towards his Beatrice; their meeting together
in the <i>Paradiso</i>; his gazing in her pure transfigured
eyes, her that had been purified by death so long,
separated from him so far:&mdash;one likens it to the
gong of angels; it is among the purest utterances
of affection, perhaps the very purest, that ever came
out of a human soul.</p>

<p>For the <i>intense</i> Dante is intense in all things; he
has got into the essence of all. His intellectual insight
as painter, on occasion too as reasoner, is but the
result of all other sorts of intensity. Morally great,
above all, we must call him; it is the beginning of
all. His scorn, his grief are as transcendent as his
love;&mdash;as indeed, what are they but the <i>inverse</i> or
<i>converse</i> of his love? &#8216;<i>A Dio spiacenti, ed a&#8217; nemici
sui</i>, Hateful to God and to the enemies of God:&#8217;
lofty scorn, unappeasable silent reprobation and
aversion; &#8216;<i>Non ragionam di lor</i>, We will not speak
of <i>them</i>, look only and pass.&#8217; Or think of this:
&#8216;They have not the <i>hope</i> to die, <i>Non han speranza
di morte</i>.&#8217; One day, it had risen sternly benign on
the scathed heart of Dante, that he, wretched,
never-resting, worn as he was, would full surely <i>die</i>;
&#8216;that Destiny itself could not doom him not to die.&#8217;
Such words are in this man. For rigour, earnestness
and depth, he is not to be paralleled in the modern
world; to seek his parallel we must go into the
Hebrew Bible, and live with the antique Prophets
there.</p>

<p>I do not agree with much modern criticism, in
greatly preferring the <i>Inferno</i> to the two other parts
of the Divine <i>Commedia</i>. Such preference belongs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
I imagine, to our general Byronism of taste, and is
like to be a transient feeling. The <i>Purgatorio</i> and
<i>Paradiso</i>, especially the former, one would almost
say, is even more excellent than it. It is a noble
thing that <i>Purgatorio</i>, &#8216;Mountain of Purification&#8217;;
an emblem of the noblest conception of that age.
If Sin is so fatal, and Hell is and must be so rigorous,
awful, yet in Repentance too is man purified;
Repentance is the grand Christian act. It is beautiful
how Dante works it out. The <i>tremolar dell&#8217;
onde</i>, that &#8216;trembling&#8217; of the ocean-waves, under
the first pure gleam of morning, dawning afar on
the wandering Two, is as the type of an altered
mood. Hope has now dawned; never-dying Hope,
if in company still with heavy sorrow. The obscure
sojourn of daemons and reprobate is under foot;
a soft breathing of penitence mounts higher and
higher, to the Throne of Mercy itself. &#8216;Pray for
me,&#8217; the denizens of that Mount of Pain all say to
him. &#8216;Tell my Giovanna to pray for me,&#8217; my
daughter Giovanna; &#8216;I think her mother loves me
no more!&#8217; They toil painfully up by that winding
steep, &#8216;bent-down like corbels of a building,&#8217; some
of them,&mdash;crushed together so &#8216;for the sin of pride&#8217;;
yet nevertheless in years, in ages and aeons, they
shall have reached the top, which is Heaven&#8217;s gate,
and by Mercy shall have been admitted in. The
joy too of all, when one has prevailed; the whole
Mountain shakes with joy, and a psalm of praise
rises, when one soul has perfected repentance, and
got its sin and misery left behind! I call all this
a noble embodiment of a true noble thought.</p>

<p>But indeed the Three compartments mutually
support one another, are indispensable to one
another. The <i>Paradiso</i>, a kind of inarticulate music<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
to me, is the redeeming side of the <i>Inferno</i>; the
<i>Inferno</i> without it were untrue. All three make up
the true Unseen World, as figured in the Christianity
of the Middle Ages; a thing for ever memorable,
for ever true in the essence of it, to all men. It was
perhaps delineated in no human soul with such
depth of veracity as in this of Dante&#8217;s; a man <i>sent</i>
to sing it, to keep it long memorable. Very notable
with what brief simplicity he passes out of the
every-day reality, into the Invisible one; and in
the second or third stanza, we find ourselves in the
World of Spirits; and dwell there, as among things
palpable, indubitable! To Dante they <i>were</i> so;
the real world, as it is called, and its facts, was
but the threshold to an infinitely higher Fact of a
World. At bottom, the one was as <i>preter</i>natural
as the other. Has not each man a soul? He will
not only be a spirit, but is one. To the earnest
Dante it is all one visible Fact; he believes it, sees
it; is the Poet of it in virtue of that. Sincerity,
I say again, is the saving merit, now as always.</p>

<p>Dante&#8217;s Hell, Purgatory, Paradise, are a symbol
withal, an emblematic representation of his Belief
about this Universe:&mdash;some Critic in a future age,
like those Scandinavian ones the other day, who
has ceased altogether to think as Dante did, may
find this too all an &#8216;Allegory&#8217;, perhaps an idle
Allegory! It is a sublime embodiment, or sublimest,
of the soul of Christianity. It expresses, as
in huge world-wide architectural emblems, how the
Christian Dante felt Good and Evil to be the two
polar elements of this Creation, on which it all
turns; that these two differ not by <i>preferability</i> of
one to the other, but by incompatibility absolute
and infinite; that the one is excellent and high as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
light and Heaven, the other hideous, black as
Gehenna and the Pit of Hell! Everlasting Justice,
yet with Penitence, with everlasting Pity,&mdash;all
Christianism, as Dante and the Middle Ages had it,
is emblemed there. Emblemed: and yet, as I urged
the other day, with what entire truth of purpose;
how unconscious of any embleming! Hell, Purgatory,
Paradise: these things were not fashioned
as emblems; was there, in our Modern European
Mind, any thought at all of their being emblems!
Were they not indubitable awful facts; the whole
heart of man taking them for practically true, all
Nature everywhere confirming them? So is it
always in these things. Men do not believe an
Allegory. The future Critic, whatever his new
thought may be, who considers this of Dante to
have been all got-up as an Allegory, will commit
one sore mistake!&mdash;Paganism we recognized as
a veracious expression of the earnest awe-struck
feeling of man towards the Universe; veracious,
true once, and still not without worth for us. But
mark here the difference of Paganism and Christianism;
one great difference. Paganism emblemed
chiefly the Operations of Nature; the destinies,
efforts, combinations, vicissitudes of things and
men in this world; Christianism emblemed the Law
of Human Duty, the Moral Law of Man. One was
for the sensuous nature: a rude helpless utterance
of the <i>first</i> Thought of men,&mdash;the chief recognized
virtue, Courage, Superiority to Fear. The other
was not for the sensuous nature, but for the moral.
What a progress is here, if in that one respect only!&mdash;</p>


<p class="newsection">And so in this Dante, as we said, had ten silent
centuries, in a very strange way, found a voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
The <i>Divina Commedia</i> is of Dante&#8217;s writing; yet
in truth <i>it</i> belongs to ten Christian centuries, only
the finishing of it is Dante&#8217;s. So always. The
craftsman there, the smith with that metal of his,
with these tools, with these cunning methods,&mdash;how
little of all he does is properly <i>his</i> work! All
past inventive men work there with him;&mdash;as
indeed with all of us, in all things. Dante is the
spokesman of the Middle Ages; the Thought they
lived by stands here, in everlasting music. These
sublime ideas of his, terrible and beautiful, are the
fruit of the Christian Meditation of all the good men
who had gone before him. Precious they; but also
is not he precious? Much, had not he spoken, would
have been dumb; not dead, yet living voiceless.</p>

<p>On the whole, is it not an utterance, this mystic
Song, at once of one of the greatest human souls,
and of the highest thing that Europe had hitherto
realized for itself? Christianism, as Dante sings it,
is another than Paganism in the rude Norse mind;
another than &#8216;Bastard Christianism&#8217; half articulately
spoken in the Arab desert, seven hundred
years before!&mdash;The noblest <i>idea</i> made <i>real</i> hitherto
among men, is sung, and emblemed forth abidingly,
by one of the noblest men. In the one sense and in
the other, are we not right glad to possess it? As
I calculate, it may last yet for long thousands of years.
For the thing that is uttered from the inmost parts
of a man&#8217;s soul, differs altogether from what is
uttered by the outer part. The outer is of the day,
under the empire of mode; the outer passes away,
in swift endless changes; the inmost is the same
yesterday, to-day, and for ever. True souls, in all
generations of the world, who look on this Dante,
will find a brotherhood in him; the deep sincerity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
of his thoughts, his woes and hopes, will speak likewise
to their sincerity; they will feel that this
Dante too was a brother. Napoleon in Saint-Helena
is charmed with the genial veracity of old Homer.
The oldest Hebrew Prophet, under a vesture the
most diverse from ours, does yet, because he speaks
from the heart of man, speak to all men&#8217;s hearts.
It is the one sole secret of continuing long memorable.
Dante, for depth of sincerity, is like an antique
Prophet too; his words, like theirs, come from his
very heart. One need not wonder if it were predicted
that his Poem might be the most enduring
thing our Europe has yet made; for nothing so
endures as a truly spoken word. All cathedrals,
pontificalities, brass and stone, and outer arrangement
never so lasting, are brief in comparison to an
unfathomable heart-song like this: one feels as if
it might survive, still of importance to men, when
these had all sunk into new irrecognizable combinations,
and had ceased individually to be.
Europe has made much; great cities, great empires,
encyclopaedias, creeds, bodies of opinion and practice:
but it has made little of the class of Dante&#8217;s
Thought. Homer yet <i>is</i>, veritably present face to
face with every open soul of us; and Greece, where
is <i>it</i>? Desolate for thousands of years; away,
vanished; a bewildered heap of stones and rubbish,
the life and existence of it all gone. Like a dream;
like the dust of King Agamemnon! Greece was;
Greece, except in the <i>words</i> it spoke, is not.</p>

<p>The uses of this Dante? We will not say much
about his &#8216;uses&#8217;. A human soul who has once got
into that primal element of <i>Song</i>, and sung forth
fitly somewhat therefrom, has worked in the <i>depths</i>
of our existence; feeding through long times the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
life-<i>roots</i> of all excellent human things whatsoever,&mdash;in
a way that &#8216;utilities&#8217; will not succeed well in
calculating! We will not estimate the Sun by the
quantity of gas-light it saves us; Dante shall be
invaluable, or of no value. One remark I may make:
the contrast in this respect between the Hero-Poet
and the Hero-Prophet. In a hundred years,
Mahomet, as we saw, had his Arabians at Grenada
and at Delhi; Dante&#8217;s Italians seem to be yet very
much where they were. Shall we say, then, Dante&#8217;s
effect on the world was small in comparison? Not
so: his arena is far more restricted; but also it
is far nobler, clearer;&mdash;perhaps not less but more
important. Mahomet speaks to great masses of
men, in the coarse dialect adapted to such; a dialect
filled with inconsistencies, crudities, follies: on the
great masses alone can he act, and there with good
and with evil strangely blended. Dante speaks to
the noble, the pure and great, in all times and places.
Neither does he grow obsolete, as the other does.
Dante burns as a pure star, fixed there in the firmament,
at which the great and the high of all ages
kindle themselves: he is the possession of all the
chosen of the world for uncounted time. Dante,
one calculates, may long survive Mahomet. In this
way the balance may be made straight again.</p>

<p>But, at any rate, it is not by what is called their
effect on the world by what <i>we</i> can judge of their
effect there, that a man and his work are measured.
Effect? Influence? Utility? Let a man <i>do</i> his
work; the fruit of it is the care of Another than he.
It will grow its own fruit; and whether embodied
in Caliph Thrones and Arabian Conquests, so that
it &#8216;fills all Morning and Evening Newspapers&#8217;, and
all Histories, which are a kind of distilled Newspapers;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
or not embodied so at all;&mdash;what matters
that? That is not the real fruit of it! The Arabian
Caliph, in so far only as he did something, was
something. If the great Cause of Man, and Man&#8217;s
work in God&#8217;s Earth, got no furtherance from the
Arabian Caliph, then no matter how many scimitars
he drew, how many gold piastres pocketed, and
what uproar and blaring he made in this world,&mdash;<i>he</i>
was but a loud-sounding inanity and futility;
at bottom, he <i>was</i> not at all. Let us honour the
great empire of <i>Silence</i>, once more! The boundless
treasury which we do <i>not</i> jingle in our pockets, or
count up and present before men! It is perhaps,
of all things, the usefulest for each of us to do, in
these loud times.&mdash;&nbsp;&mdash;</p>


<p class="newsection">As Dante, the Italian man, was sent into our world
to embody musically the Religion of the Middle Ages,
the Religion of our Modern Europe, its Inner Life;
so Shakespeare, we may say, embodies for us the
Outer Life of our Europe as developed then, its
chivalries, courtesies, humours, ambitions, what
practical way of thinking, acting, looking at the
world, men then had. As in Homer we may still
construe Old Greece; so in Shakespeare and Dante,
after thousands of years, what our Modern Europe
was, in Faith and in Practice, will still be legible.
Dante has given us the Faith or soul; Shakespeare,
in a not less noble way, has given us the Practice
or body. This latter also we were to have; a man
was sent for it, the man Shakespeare. Just when
that chivalry way of life had reached its last finish,
and was on the point of breaking down into slow
or swift dissolution, as we now see it everywhere,
this other sovereign Poet, with his seeing eye, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
his perennial singing voice, was sent to take note
of it, to give long-enduring record of it. Two fit
men: Dante, deep, fierce as the central fire of the
world; Shakespeare, wide, placid, far-seeing, as the
Sun, the upper light of the world. Italy produced
the one world-voice; we English had the honour
of producing the other.</p>

<p>Curious enough how, as it were by mere accident,
this man came to us. I think always, so great, quiet,
complete and self-sufficing is this Shakespeare, had
the Warwickshire Squire not prosecuted him for
deer-stealing, we had perhaps never heard of him
as a Poet! The woods and skies, the rustic Life of
Man in Stratford there, had been enough for this
man! But indeed that strange outbudding of our
whole English Existence, which we call the Elizabethan
Era, did not it too come as of its own accord?
The &#8216;Tree Igdrasil&#8217; buds and withers by its own
laws,&mdash;too deep for our scanning. Yet it does bud
and wither, and every bough and leaf of it is there,
by fixed eternal laws; not a Sir Thomas Lucy but
comes at the hour fit for him. Curious, I say, and
not sufficiently considered: how everything does
co-operate with all; not a leaf rotting on the highway
but is indissoluble portion of solar and stellar
systems; no thought, word or act of man but has
sprung withal out of all men, and works sooner or
later, recognizably or irrecognizably, on all men!
It is all a Tree: circulation of sap and influences,
mutual communication of every minutest leaf with
the lowest talon of a root, with every other greatest
and minutest portion of the whole. The Tree
Igdrasil, that has its roots down in the Kingdoms
of Hela and Death, and whose boughs overspread
the highest Heaven!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>In some sense it may be said that this glorious
Elizabethan Era with its Shakespeare, as the outcome
and flowerage of all which had preceded it,
is itself attributable to the Catholicism of the Middle
Ages. The Christian Faith, which was the theme
of Dante&#8217;s Song, had produced this Practical Life
which Shakespeare was to sing. For Religion then,
as it now and always is, was the soul of Practice;
the primary vital fact in men&#8217;s life. And remark
here, as rather curious, that Middle-Age Catholicism
was abolished, so far as Acts of Parliament could
abolish it, before Shakespeare, the noblest product
of it, made his appearance. He did make his appearance
nevertheless. Nature at her own time, with
Catholicism or what else might be necessary, sent
him forth; taking small thought of Acts of Parliament.
King-Henrys, Queen-Elizabeths go their
way; and Nature too goes hers. Acts of Parliament,
on the whole, are small, notwithstanding the noise
they make. What Act of Parliament, debate at
St. Stephens, on the hustings or elsewhere, was it
that brought this Shakespeare into being? No
dining at Freemasons&#8217; Tavern, opening subscription-lists,
selling of shares, and infinite other jangling and
true or false endeavouring! This Elizabethan Era,
and all its nobleness and blessedness, came without
proclamation, preparation of ours. Priceless Shakespeare
was the free gift of Nature; given altogether
silently;&mdash;received altogether silently, as if it had
been a thing of little account. And yet, very literally,
it is a priceless thing. One should look at that side
of matters too.</p>

<p>Of this Shakespeare of ours, perhaps the opinion
one sometimes hears a little idolatrously expressed
is, in fact, the right one; I think the best judgement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
not of this country only, but of Europe at large, is
slowly pointing to the conclusion, That Shakespeare
is the chief of all Poets hitherto; the greatest intellect
who, in our recorded world, has left record of
himself in the way of literature. On the whole, I
know not such a power of vision, such a faculty of
thought, if we take all the characters of it, in any
other man. Such a calmness of depth; placid joyous
strength; all things imaged in that great soul of his
so true and clear, as in a tranquil unfathomable sea!
It has been said, that in the constructing of Shakespeare&#8217;s
Dramas there is, apart from all other
&#8216;faculties&#8217; as they are called, an understanding
manifested, equal to that in Bacon&#8217;s <i>Novum Organum</i>.
That is true; and it is not a truth that
strikes every one. It would become more apparent
if we tried, any of us for himself, how, out of Shakespeare&#8217;s
dramatic materials, <i>we</i> could fashion such
a result! The built house seems all so fit,&mdash;everyway
as it should be, as if it came there by its
own law and the nature of things,&mdash;we forget the
rude disorderly quarry it was shaped from. The
very perfection of the house, as if Nature herself had
made it, hides the builder&#8217;s merit. Perfect, more
perfect than any other man, we may call Shakespeare
in this: he discerns, knows as by instinct,
what condition he works under, what his materials
are, what his own force and its relation to them is.
It is not a transitory glance of insight that will
suffice; it is deliberate illumination of the whole
matter; it is a calmly <i>seeing</i> eye; a great intellect,
in short. How a man, of some wide thing that he
has witnessed, will construct a narrative, what kind
of picture and delineation he will give of it,&mdash;is the
best measure you could get of what intellect is in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the man. Which circumstance is vital and shall
stand prominent; which unessential, fit to be suppressed;
where is the true <i>beginning</i>, the true
sequence and ending? To find out this, you task
the whole force of insight that is in the man. He
must <i>understand</i> the thing; according to the depth
of his understanding, will the fitness of his answer
be. You will try him so. Does like join itself to like;
does the spirit of method stir in that confusion, so
that its embroilment becomes order? Can the man
say, <i>Fiat lux</i>, Let there be light; and out of chaos
make a world? Precisely as there, is <i>light</i> in himself,
will he accomplish this.</p>

<p>Or indeed we may say again, it is in what I called
Portrait-painting, delineating of men and things,
especially of men, that Shakespeare is great. All
the greatness of the man comes out decisively here.
It is unexampled, I think, that calm creative perspicacity
of Shakespeare. The thing he looks at
reveals not this or that face of it, but its inmost
heart and generic secret: it dissolves itself as in
light before him, so that he discerns the perfect
structure of it. Creative, we said: poetic creation,
what is this too but <i>seeing</i> the thing sufficiently?
The <i>word</i> that will describe the thing, follows of
itself from such clear intense sight of the thing.
And is not Shakespeare&#8217;s <i>morality</i>, his valour, candour,
tolerance, truthfulness; his whole victorious
strength and greatness, which can triumph over
such obstructions, visible there too? Great as the
world! No <i>twisted</i>, poor convex-concave mirror,
reflecting all objects with its own convexities and
concavities; a perfectly <i>level</i> mirror;&mdash;that is to
say withal, if we will understand it, a man justly
related to all things and men, a good man. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
truly a lordly spectacle how this great soul takes in
all kinds of men and objects, a Falstaff, an Othello,
a Juliet, a Coriolanus; sets them all forth to us
in their round completeness; loving, just, the equal
brother of all. <i>Novum Organum</i>, and all the intellect
you will find in Bacon, is of a quite secondary order;
earthy, material, poor in comparison with this.
Among modern men, one finds, in strictness, almost
nothing of the same rank. Goethe alone, since the
days of Shakespeare, reminds me of it. Of him too
you say that he <i>saw</i> the object; you may say what
he himself says of Shakespeare: &#8216;His characters are
like watches with dial-plates of transparent crystal;
they show you the hour like others, and the inward
mechanism also is all visible.&#8217;</p>

<p>The seeing eye! It is this that discloses the inner
harmony of things; what Nature meant, what
musical idea Nature has wrapped up in these often
rough embodiments. Something she did mean.
To the seeing eye that something were discernible.
Are they base, miserable things? You can laugh
over them, you can weep over them; you can in
some way or other genially relate yourself to them;&mdash;you
can, at lowest, hold your peace about them,
turn away your own and others&#8217; face from them,
till the hour come for practically exterminating and
extinguishing them! At bottom, it is the Poet&#8217;s
first gift, as it is all men&#8217;s, that he have intellect
enough. He will be a Poet if he have: a Poet in
word; or failing that, perhaps still better, a Poet
in act. Whether he write at all; and if so, whether
in prose or in verse, will depend on accidents: who
knows on what extremely trivial accidents,&mdash;perhaps
on his having had a singing-master, on his being
taught to sing in his boyhood! But the faculty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
which enables him to discern the inner heart of
things, and the harmony that dwells there (for what
soever exists has a harmony in the heart of it, or it
would not hold together and exist), is not the result
of habits or accidents, but the gift of Nature herself;
the primary outfit for a Heroic Man in what sort
soever. To the Poet, as to every other, we say first
of all, <i>See</i>. If you cannot do that, it is of no use to
keep stringing rhymes together, jingling sensibilities
against each other, and <i>name</i> yourself a Poet; there
is no hope for you. If you can, there is, in prose or
verse, in action or speculation, all manner of hope.
The crabbed old Schoolmaster used to ask, when
they brought him a new pupil, &#8216;But are ye sure he&#8217;s
<i>not a dunce</i>?&#8217; Why, really one might ask the same
thing, in regard to every man proposed for whatsoever
function; and consider it as the one inquiry
needful: Are ye sure he&#8217;s not a dunce? There is,
in this world, no other entirely fatal person.</p>

<p>For, in fact, I say the degree of vision that dwells
in a man is a correct measure of the man. If called
to define Shakespeare&#8217;s faculty, I should say
superiority of Intellect, and think I had included
all under that. What indeed are faculties? We
talk of faculties as if they were distinct, things
separable; as if a man had intellect, imagination,
fancy, &amp;c., as he has hands, feet and arms. That
is a capital error. Then again, we hear of a man&#8217;s
&#8216;intellectual nature&#8217;, and of his &#8216;moral nature&#8217;, as
if these again were divisible, and existed apart.
Necessities of language do perhaps prescribe such
forms of utterance; we must speak, I am aware,
in that way, if we are to speak at all. But words
ought not to harden into things for us. It seems to
me, our apprehension of this matter is, for most part,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
radically falsified thereby. We ought to know
withal, and to keep for ever in mind, that these
divisions are at bottom but <i>names</i>; that man&#8217;s
spiritual nature, the vital Force which dwells in
him, is essentially one and indivisible; that what
we call imagination, fancy, understanding, and so
forth, are but different figures of the same Power
of Insight, all indissolubly connected with each
other, physiognomically related; that if we knew
one of them, we might know all of them. Morality
itself, what we call the moral quality of a man, what
is this but another <i>side</i> of the one vital Force whereby
he is and works? All that a man does is physiognomical
of him. You may see how a man would
fight, by the way in which he sings; his courage, or
want of courage, is visible in the word he utters, in
the opinion he has formed, no less than in the stroke
he strikes. He is <i>one</i>; and preaches the same Self
abroad in all these ways.</p>

<p>Without hands a man might have feet, and could
still walk: but, consider it,&mdash;without morality,
intellect were impossible for him; a thoroughly
immoral <i>man</i> could not know anything at all! To
know a thing, what we can call knowing, a man must
first <i>love</i> the thing, sympathize with it: that is, be
<i>virtuously</i> related to it. If he have not the justice
to put down his own selfishness at every turn, the
courage to stand by the dangerous-true at every
turn, how shall he know? His virtues, all of them,
will lie recorded in his knowledge. Nature, with
her truth, remains to the bad, to the selfish and the
pusillanimous for ever a sealed book: what such
can know of Nature is mean, superficial, small; for
the uses of the day merely.&mdash;But does not the very
Fox know something of Nature? Exactly so: it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
knows where the geese lodge! The human Reynard,
very frequent everywhere in the world, what more
does he know but this and the like of this? Nay,
it should be considered too, that if the Fox had not
a certain vulpine <i>morality</i>, he could not even know
where the geese were, or get at the geese! If he
spent his time in splenetic atrabiliar reflections on
his own misery, his ill usage by Nature, Fortune and
other Foxes, and so forth; and had not courage,
promptitude, practicality, and other suitable vulpine
gifts and graces, he would catch no geese. We
may say of the Fox too, that his morality and insight
are of the same dimensions; different faces of the
same internal unity of vulpine life!&mdash;These things
are worth stating; for the contrary of them acts
with manifold very baleful perversion, in this time:
what limitations, modifications they require, your
own candour will supply.</p>

<p>If I say, therefore, that Shakespeare is the greatest
of Intellects, I have said all concerning him. But
there is more in Shakespeare&#8217;s intellect than we have
yet seen. It is what I call an unconscious intellect;
there is more virtue in it than he himself is aware
of. Novalis beautifully remarks of him, that those
Dramas of his are Products of Nature too, deep as
Nature herself. I find a great truth in this saying.
Shakespeare&#8217;s Art is not Artifice; the noblest worth
of it is not there by plan or precontrivance. It
grows up from the deeps of Nature, through this
noble sincere soul, who is a voice of Nature. The
latest generations of men will find new meanings in
Shakespeare, new elucidations of their own human
being; &#8216;new harmonies with the infinite structure
of the Universe; concurrences with later ideas,
affinities with the higher powers and senses of man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>&#8217;
This well deserves meditating. It is Nature&#8217;s highest
award to a true simple great soul, that he get thus
to be <i>a part of herself</i>. Such a man&#8217;s works, whatsoever
he with utmost conscious exertion and forethought
shall accomplish, grow up withal <i>un</i>consciously,
from the unknown deeps in him;&mdash;as the
oak-tree grows from the Earth&#8217;s bosom, as the
mountains and waters shape themselves; with a
symmetry grounded on Nature&#8217;s own laws, conformable
to all Truth whatsoever. How much in
Shakespeare lies hid; his sorrows, his silent struggles
known to himself; much that was not known at all,
not speakable at all: like <i>roots</i>, like sap and forces
working underground! Speech is great; but Silence
is greater.</p>

<p>Withal the joyful tranquillity of this man is notable.
I will not blame Dante for his misery: it is as battle
without victory; but true battle,&mdash;the first, indispensable
thing. Yet I call Shakespeare greater than
Dante, in that he fought truly, and did conquer.
Doubt it not, he had his own sorrows: those
<i>Sonnets</i> of his will even testify expressly in what
deep waters he had waded, and swum struggling
for his life;&mdash;as what man like him ever failed to
have to do? It seems to me a heedless notion,
our common one, that he sat like a bird on the
bough; and sang forth, free and offhand, never
knowing the troubles of other men. Not so; with
no man is it so. How could a man travel forward
from rustic deer-poaching to such tragedy-writing,
and not fall in with sorrows by the way? Or, still
better, how could a man delineate a Hamlet, a
Coriolanus, a Macbeth, so many suffering heroic
hearts, if his own heroic heart had never suffered?&mdash;And
now, in contrast with all this, observe his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
mirthfulness, his genuine overflowing love of
laughter! You would say, in no point does he
<i>exaggerate</i> but only in laughter. Fiery objurgations,
words that pierce and burn, are to be found
in Shakespeare; yet he is always in measure here;
never what Johnson would remark as a specially
&#8216;good hater&#8217;. But his laughter seems to pour
from him in floods; he heaps all manner of ridiculous
nicknames on the butt he is bantering,
tumbles and tosses him in all sorts of horse-play;
you would say, roars and laughs. And then, if not
always the finest, it is always a genial laughter.
Not at mere weakness, at misery or poverty;
never. No man who <i>can</i> laugh, what we call
laughing, will laugh at these things. It is some
poor character only <i>desiring</i> to laugh, and have
the credit of wit, that does so. Laughter means
sympathy; good laughter is not &#8216;the crackling
of thorns under the pot&#8217;. Even at stupidity and
pretension this Shakespeare does not laugh otherwise
than genially. Dogberry and Verges tickle
our very hearts; and we dismiss them covered
with explosions of laughter: but we like the poor
fellows only the better for our laughing; and hope
they will get on well there, and continue Presidents
of the City-watch.&mdash;Such laughter, like sunshine
on the deep sea, is very beautiful to me.</p>


<p class="newsection">We have no room to speak of Shakespeare&#8217;s
individual works; though perhaps there is much
still waiting to be said on that head. Had we,
for instance, all his plays reviewed as <i>Hamlet</i>, in
<i>Wilhelm Meister</i>, is! A thing which might, one
day, be done. August Wilhelm Schlegel has a
remark on his Historical Plays, <i>Henry Fifth</i> and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
the others, which is worth remembering. He calls
them a kind of National Epic. Marlborough, you
recollect, said, he knew no English History but
what he had learned from Shakespeare. There
are really, if we look to it, few as memorable
Histories. The great salient points are admirably
seized; all rounds itself off, into a kind of rhythmic
coherence; it is, as Schlegel says, <i>epic</i>;&mdash;as indeed
all delineation by a great thinker will be. There
are right beautiful things in those Pieces, which
indeed together form one beautiful thing. That
battle of Agincourt strikes me as one of the most
perfect things, in its sort, we anywhere have of
Shakespeare&#8217;s. The description of the two hosts:
the worn-out, jaded English; the dread hour, big
with destiny, when the battle shall begin; and
then that deathless valour: &#8216;Ye good yeomen,
whose limbs were made in England!&#8217; There is
a noble Patriotism in it,&mdash;far other than the
&#8216;indifference&#8217; you sometimes hear ascribed to
Shakespeare. A true English heart breathes,
calm and strong, through the whole business; not
boisterous, protrusive; all the better for that.
There is a sound in it like the ring of steel. This
man too had a right stroke in him, had it come
to that!</p>

<p>But I will say, of Shakespeare&#8217;s works generally,
that we have no full impress of him there; even
as full as we have of many men. His works are
so many windows, through which we see a glimpse
of the world that was in him. All his works seem,
comparatively speaking, cursory, imperfect, written
under cramping circumstances; giving only here
and there a note of the full utterance of the man.
Passages there are that come upon you like splendour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
out of Heaven; bursts of radiance, illuminating
the very heart of the thing: you say, &#8216;That
is <i>true</i>, spoken once and forever; wheresoever and
whensoever there is an open human soul, that will
be recognized as true!&#8217; Such bursts, however,
make us feel that the surrounding matter is not
radiant; that it is, in part, temporary, conventional.
Alas, Shakespeare had to write for the
Globe Playhouse: his great soul had to crush
itself, as it could, into that and no other mould.
It was with him, then, as it is with us all. No man
works save under conditions. The sculptor cannot
set his own free Thought before us; but his
Thought as he could translate it into the stone
that was given, with the tools that were given.
<i>Disjecta membra</i> are all that we find of any Poet,
or of any man.</p>


<p class="newsection">Whoever looks intelligently at this Shakespeare
may recognize that he too was a <i>Prophet</i>, in his
way; of an insight analogous to the Prophetic,
though he took it up in another strain. Nature
seemed to this man also divine; <i>un</i>speakable,
deep as Tophet, high as Heaven: &#8216;We are such
stuff as Dreams are made of!&#8217; That scroll in
Westminster Abbey, which few read with understanding,
is of the depth of any Seer. But the
man sang; did not preach, except musically. We
called Dante the melodious Priest of Middle-Age
Catholicism. May we not call Shakespeare the
still more melodious Priest of a <i>true</i> Catholicism,
the &#8216;Universal Church&#8217; of the Future and of all
times? No narrow superstition, harsh asceticism,
intolerance, fanatical fierceness or perversion: a
Revelation, so far as it goes, that such a thousandfold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
hidden beauty and divineness dwells in all
Nature; which let all men worship as they can!
We may say without offence, that there rises
a kind of universal Psalm out of this Shakespeare
too; not unfit to make itself heard among the still
more sacred Psalms. Not in disharmony with
these, if we understood them, but in unison!&mdash;I
cannot call this Shakespeare a &#8216;Sceptic&#8217;, as some
do; his indifference to the creeds and theological
quarrels of his time misleading them. No: neither
unpatriotic, though he says little about his Patriotism;
no sceptic, though he says little about his
Faith. Such &#8216;indifference&#8217; was the fruit of his
greatness withal: his whole heart was in his own
grand sphere of worship (we may call it such);
these other controversies, vitally important to
other men, were not vital to him.</p>

<p>But call it worship, call it what you will, is it
not a right glorious thing and set of things, this
that Shakespeare has brought us? For myself,
I feel that there is actually a kind of sacredness
in the fact of such a man being sent into this
Earth. Is he not an eye to us all; a blessed
heaven-sent Bringer of Light?&mdash;And, at bottom,
was it not perhaps far better that this Shakespeare,
everyway an unconscious man, was <i>conscious</i> of
no Heavenly message? He did not feel, like
Mahomet, because he saw into those internal
Splendours, that he specially was the &#8216;Prophet
of God&#8217;: and was he not greater than Mahomet
in that? Greater; and also, if we compute
strictly, as we did in Dante&#8217;s case, more successful.
It was intrinsically an error that notion of
Mahomet&#8217;s, of his supreme Prophethood; and has
come down to us inextricably involved in error to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
this day; dragging along with it such a coil of
fables, impurities, intolerances, as makes it a questionable
step for me here and now to say, as I have
done, that Mahomet was a true Speaker at all, and
not rather an ambitious charlatan, perversity, and
simulacrum, no Speaker, but a Babbler! Even
in Arabia, as I compute, Mahomet will have
exhausted himself and become obsolete, while this
Shakespeare, this Dante may still be young;&mdash;while
this Shakespeare may still pretend to be a
Priest of Mankind, of Arabia as of other places,
for unlimited periods to come! Compared with
any speaker or singer one knows, even with
Aeschylus or Homer, why should he not, for
veracity and universality, last like them? He is
<i>sincere</i> as they; reaches deep down like them, to
the universal and perennial. But as for Mahomet,
I think it had been better for him <i>not</i> to be so
conscious! Alas, poor Mahomet; all that he was
<i>conscious</i> of was a mere error; a futility and
triviality,&mdash;as indeed such ever is. The truly great
in him too was the unconscious: that he was
a wild Arab lion of the desert, and did speak out
with that great thunder-voice of his, not by words
which he <i>thought</i> to be great, but by actions, by
feelings, by a history which <i>were</i> great! His Koran
has become a stupid piece of prolix absurdity; we
do not believe, like him, that God wrote that!
The Great Man here too, as always, is a Force of
Nature: whatsoever is truly great in him springs
up from the <i>in</i>articulate deeps.</p>


<p class="newsection">Well: this is our poor Warwickshire Peasant,
who rose to be Manager of a Playhouse, so that he
could live without begging; whom the Earl of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Southampton cast some kind glances on; whom
Sir Thomas Lucy, many thanks to him, was for
sending to the Treadmill! We did not account
him a god, like Odin, while he dwelt with us;&mdash;on
which point there were much to be said. But I
will say rather, or repeat: In spite of the sad state
Hero-worship now lies in, consider what this
Shakespeare has actually become among us.
Which Englishman we ever made, in this land of
ours, which million of Englishmen, would we not
give up rather than the Stratford Peasant? There
is no regiment of highest Dignitaries that we would
sell him for. He is the grandest thing we have yet
done. For our honour among foreign nations, as
an ornament to our English Household, what item
is there that we would not surrender rather than
him? Consider now, if they asked us, Will you
give up your Indian Empire or your Shakespeare,
you English; never have had any Indian Empire,
or never have had any Shakespeare? Really it
were a grave question. Official persons would
answer doubtless in official language; but we, for
our part too, should not we be forced to answer:
Indian Empire, or no Indian Empire; we cannot
do without Shakespeare! Indian Empire will go,
at any rate, some day; but this Shakespeare does
not go, he lasts for ever with us; we cannot give
up our Shakespeare!</p>

<p>Nay, apart from spiritualities; and considering
him merely as a real, marketable, tangibly-useful
possession. England, before long, this Island of
ours, will hold but a small fraction of the English:
in America, in New Holland, east and west to the
very Antipodes, there will be a Saxondom covering
great spaces of the Globe. And now, what is it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
that can keep all these together into virtually one
Nation, so that they do not fall out and fight, but
live at peace, in brotherlike intercourse, helping
one another? This is justly regarded as the
greatest practical problem, the thing all manner
of sovereignties and governments are here to
accomplish: what is it that will accomplish this?
Acts of Parliament, administrative prime-ministers
cannot. America is parted from us, so far as Parliament
could part it. Call it not fantastic, for
there is much reality in it: Here, I say, is an
English King, whom no time or chance, Parliament
or combination of Parliaments, can dethrone!
This King Shakespeare, does not he shine, in
crowned sovereignty, over us all, as the noblest,
gentlest, yet strongest of rallying-signs; <i>in</i>destructible;
really more valuable in that point of view,
than any other means or appliance whatsoever?
We can fancy him as radiant aloft over all the
Nations of Englishmen, a thousand years hence.
From Paramatta, from New York, wheresoever,
under what sort of Parish-Constable soever,
English men and women are, they will say to
one another: &#8216;Yes, this Shakespeare is ours: we
produced him, we speak and think by him; we
are of one blood and kind with him.&#8217; The most
common-sense politician, too, if he pleases, may
think of that.</p>

<p>Yes, truly, it is a great thing for a Nation that
it get an articulate voice; that it produce a man
who will speak forth melodiously what the heart
of it means! Italy, for example, poor Italy lies
dismembered, scattered asunder, not appearing in
any protocol or treaty as a unity at all; yet the
noble Italy is actually <i>one</i>: Italy produced its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
Dante: Italy can speak! The Czar of all the
Russias, he is strong, with so many bayonets,
Cossacks, and cannons: and does a great feat in
keeping such a tract of Earth politically together;
but he cannot yet speak. Something great in him,
but it is a dumb greatness. He has had no voice
of genius, to be heard of all men and times. He
must learn to speak. He is a great dumb monster
hitherto. His cannons and Cossacks will all
have rusted into nonentity, while that Dante&#8217;s
voice is still audible. The Nation that has a
Dante is bound together as no dumb Russia can
be.&mdash;We must here end what we had to say of
the <i>Hero-Poet</i>.</p>

<h3>AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION<br />

WHAT IS POETRY? (1844)</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Poetry</span>, strictly and artistically so called, that
is to say, considered not merely as poetic feeling,
which is more or less shared by all the world, but
as the operation of that feeling, such as we see it in
the poet&#8217;s book, is the utterance of a passion for
truth, beauty, and power, embodying and illustrating
its conceptions by imagination and fancy,
and modulating its language on the principle of
variety in uniformity. Its means are whatever
the universe contains; and its ends, pleasure and
exaltation. Poetry stands between nature and
convention, keeping alive among us the enjoyment
of the external and the spiritual world: it has
constituted the most enduring fame of nations;
and, next to Love and Beauty, which are its
parents, is the greatest proof to man of the pleasure
to be found in all things, and of the probable riches
of infinitude.</p>

<p>Poetry is a passion,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> because it seeks the deepest
impressions; and because it must undergo, in
order to convey, them.</p>

<p>It is a passion for truth, because without truth
the impression would be false or defective.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>
<p>It is a passion for beauty, because its office is to
exalt and refine by means of pleasure, and because
beauty is nothing but the loveliest form of pleasure.</p>

<p>It is a passion for power, because power is impression
triumphant, whether over the poet, as
desired by himself, or over the reader, as affected
by the poet.</p>

<p>It embodies and illustrates its impressions by
imagination, or images of the objects of which it
treats, and other images brought in to throw light
on those objects, in order that it may enjoy and
impart the feeling of their truth in its utmost conviction
and affluence.</p>

<p>It illustrates them by fancy, which is a lighter
play of imagination, or the feeling of analogy
coming short of seriousness, in order that it may
laugh with what it loves, and show how it can
decorate it with fairy ornament.</p>

<p>It modulates what it utters, because in running
the whole round of beauty it must needs include
beauty of sound; and because, in the height of
its enjoyment, it must show the perfection of its
triumph, and make difficulty itself become part of
its facility and joy.</p>

<p>And lastly, Poetry shapes this modulation into
uniformity for its outline, and variety for its parts,
because it thus realizes the last idea of beauty
itself, which includes the charm of diversity within
the flowing round of habit and ease.</p>

<p>Poetry is imaginative passion. The quickest
and subtlest test of the possession of its essence
is in expression; the variety of things to be expressed
shows the amount of its resources; and
the continuity of the song completes the evidence of
its strength and greatness. He who has thought,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
feeling, expression, imagination, action, character,
and continuity, all in the largest amount and
highest degree, is the greatest poet.</p>

<p>Poetry includes whatsoever of painting can be
made visible to the mind&#8217;s eye, and whatsoever of
music can be conveyed by sound and proportion
without singing or instrumentation. But it far
surpasses those divine arts in suggestiveness, range,
and intellectual wealth;&mdash;the first, in expression
of thought, combination of images, and the triumph
over space and time; the second, in all that can
be done by speech, apart from the tones and modulations
of pure sound. Painting and music, however,
include all those portions of the gift of poetry
that can be expressed and heightened by the visible
and melodious. Painting, in a certain apparent
manner, is things themselves; music, in a certain
audible manner, is their very emotion and grace.
Music and painting are proud to be related to
poetry, and poetry loves and is proud of them.</p>

<p>Poetry begins where matter of fact or of science
ceases to be merely such, and to exhibit a further
truth; that is to say, the connexion it has with
the world of emotion, and its power to produce
imaginative pleasure. Inquiring of a gardener, for
instance, what flower it is we see yonder, he
answers, &#8216;a lily&#8217;. This is matter of fact. The
botanist pronounces it to be of the order of
&#8216;Hexandria Monogynia&#8217;. This is matter of
science. It is the &#8216;lady&#8217; of the garden, says
Spenser; and here we begin to have a poetical
sense of its fairness and grace. It is</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The plant and flower of <i>light</i>,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">says Ben Jonson; and poetry then shows us the
beauty of the flower in all its mystery and splendour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>If it be asked, how we know perceptions like
these to be true, the answer is, by the fact of their
existence&mdash;by the consent and delight of poetic
readers. And as feeling is the earliest teacher, and
perception the only final proof, of things the most
demonstrable by science, so the remotest imaginations
of the poets may often be found to have the
closest connexion with matter of fact; perhaps
might always be so, if the subtlety of our perceptions
were a match for the causes of them. Consider this
image of Ben Jonson&#8217;s&mdash;of a lily being the flower
of light. Light, undecomposed, is white; and as
the lily is white, and light is white, and whiteness
itself is nothing <i>but</i> light, the two things, so far, are
not merely similar, but identical. A poet might
add, by an analogy drawn from the connexion of
light and colour, that there is a &#8216;golden dawn&#8217;
issuing out of the white lily, in the rich yellow of
the stamens. I have no desire to push this
similarity farther than it may be worth. Enough
has been stated to show that, in poetical as in other
analogies, &#8216;the same feet of Nature&#8217;, as Bacon says,
may be seen &#8216;treading in different paths&#8217;; and
that the most scornful, that is to say, dullest
disciple of fact, should be cautious how he betrays
the shallowness of his philosophy by discerning no
poetry in its depths.</p>

<p>But the poet is far from dealing only with these
subtle and analogical truths. Truth of every kind
belongs to him, provided it can bud into any kind
of beauty, or is capable of being illustrated and
impressed by the poetic faculty. Nay, the simplest
truth is often so beautiful and impressive of itself,
that one of the greatest proofs of his genius consists
in his leaving it to stand alone, illustrated by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
nothing but the light of its own tears or smiles,
its own wonder, might, or playfulness. Hence the
complete effect of many a simple passage in our
old English ballads and romances, and of the passionate
sincerity in general of the greatest early
poets, such as Homer and Chaucer, who flourished
before the existence of a &#8216;literary world&#8217;, and were
not perplexed by a heap of notions and opinions,
or by doubts how emotion ought to be expressed.
The greatest of their successors never write equally
to the purpose, except when they can dismiss
everything from their minds but the like simple
truth. In the beautiful poem of <i>Sir Eger, Sir
Graham and Sir Gray-Steel</i> (see it in Ellis&#8217;s <i>Specimens</i>,
or Laing&#8217;s <i>Early Metrical Tales</i>), a knight
thinks himself disgraced in the eyes of his mistress:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>The abode of Chaucer&#8217;s <i>Reeve</i>, or Steward, in the
<i>Canterbury Tales</i>, is painted in two lines, which
nobody ever wished longer:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His wonning<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> was full fair upon an heath,<br /></span>

<p>Every one knows the words of Lear, &#8216;most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>

<span class="i4">Pray, do not mock me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am a very foolish fond old man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fourscore and upwards:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not an hour more, nor less; and, to deal plainly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fear I am not in my perfect mind.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is thus, by exquisite pertinence, melody, and
the implied power of writing with exuberance, if
need be, that beauty and truth become identical
in poetry, and that pleasure, or at the very worst,
a balm in our tears, is drawn out of pain.</p>

<p>It is a great and rare thing, and shows a lovely
imagination, when the poet can write a commentary,
as it were, of his own, on such sufficing
passages of nature, and be thanked for the addition.
There is an instance of this kind in Warner, an old
Elizabethan poet, than which I know nothing
sweeter in the world. He is speaking of Fair
Rosamond, and of a blow given her by Queen
Eleanor.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With that she dash&#8217;d her on the lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>So dy&egrave;d double red:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Hard was the heart that gave the blow,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Soft were those lips that bled</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There are different kinds and degrees of imagination,
some of them necessary to the formation of
every true poet, and all of them possessed by the
greatest. Perhaps they may be enumerated as
follows:&mdash;First, that which presents to the mind
any object or circumstance in every-day life; as
when we imagine a man holding a sword, or looking
out of a window;&mdash;Second, that which presents
real, but not every-day circumstances; as King<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Alfred tending the loaves, or Sir Philip Sidney
giving up the water to the dying soldier;&mdash;Third,
that which combines character and events directly
imitated from real life, with imitative realities of
its own invention; as the probable parts of the
histories of Priam and <i>Macbeth</i>, or what may be
called natural fiction as distinguished from supernatural;&mdash;Fourth,
that which conjures up things
and events not to be found in nature; as Homer&#8217;s
gods, and Shakespeare&#8217;s witches, enchanted horses
and spears, Ariosto&#8217;s hippogriff, &amp;c.;&mdash;Fifth, that
which, in order to illustrate or aggravate one image,
introduces another; sometimes in simile, as when
Homer compares Apollo descending in his wrath
at noon-day to the coming of night-time: sometimes
in metaphor, or simile comprised in a word, as
in Milton&#8217;s &#8216;motes that <i>people</i> the sunbeams&#8217;;
sometimes in concentrating into a word the main
history of any person or thing, past or even future,
as in the &#8216;starry Galileo&#8217; of Byron, and that
ghastly foregone conclusion of the epithet &#8216;murdered&#8217;
applied to the yet living victim in Keats&#8217;s
story from Boccaccio,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So the two brothers and their <i>murder&#8217;d</i> man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rode towards fair Florence;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">sometimes in the attribution of a certain representative
quality which makes one circumstance
stand for others; as in Milton&#8217;s grey-fly winding
its &#8216;<i>sultry</i> horn&#8217;, which epithet contains the heat
of a summer&#8217;s day;&mdash;Sixth, that which reverses
this process, and makes a variety of circumstances
take colour from one, like nature seen with jaundiced
or glad eyes, or under the influence of storm
or sunshine; as when in <i>Lycidas</i>, or the Greek<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
pastoral poets, the flowers and the flocks are made
to sympathize with a man&#8217;s death; or, in the
Italian poet, the river flowing by the sleeping
Angelica seems talking of love&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Parea che l&#8217;erba le fiorisse intorno,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>E d&#8217;amor ragionasse quella riva!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>Orlando Innamorato</i>, Canto iii.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">or in the voluptuous homage paid to the sleeping
Imogen by the very light in the chamber, and the
reaction of her own beauty upon itself; or in the
&#8216;witch element&#8217; of the tragedy of <i>Macbeth</i> and the
May-day night of <i>Faust</i>;&mdash;Seventh, and last, that
which by a single expression, apparently of the
vaguest kind, not only meets but surpasses in its
effect the extremest force of the most particular
description; as in that exquisite passage of
Coleridge&#8217;s <i>Christabel</i>, where the unsuspecting
object of the witch&#8217;s malignity is bidden to go to
bed:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth Christabel, So let it be!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the lady bade, did she.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her gentle limbs did she undress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And lay down in her loveliness;&mdash;</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">a perfect verse surely, both for feeling and music.
The very smoothness and gentleness of the limbs
is in the series of the letter <i>l&#8217;s</i>.</p>

<p>I am aware of nothing of the kind surpassing
that most lovely inclusion of physical beauty in
moral, neither can I call to mind any instances of
the imagination that turns accompaniments into
accessories, superior to those I have alluded to.
Of the class of comparison, one of the most touching
(many a tear must it have drawn from parents and
lovers) is in a stanza which has been copied into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the <i>Friar of Orders Grey</i>, out of Beaumont and
Fletcher:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Weep no more, lady, weep no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thy sorrow is in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For violets pluck&#8217;d the sweetest showers</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Will ne&#8217;er make grow again.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">And Shakespeare and Milton abound in the very
grandest; such as Antony&#8217;s likening his changing
fortunes to the cloud-rack; Lear&#8217;s appeal to the
old age of the heavens; Satan&#8217;s appearance in the
horizon, like a fleet &#8216;hanging in the clouds&#8217;; and
the comparisons of him with the comet and the
eclipse. Nor unworthy of this glorious company,
for its extraordinary combination of delicacy and
vastness, is that enchanting one of Shelley&#8217;s in
the <i>Adonais</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stains the white radiance of eternity.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">I multiply these particulars in order to impress
upon the reader&#8217;s mind the great importance of
imagination in all its phases, as a constituent part
of the highest poetic faculty.</p>

<p>The happiest instance I remember of imaginative
metaphor, is Shakespeare&#8217;s moonlight &#8216;sleeping&#8217;
on a bank; but half his poetry may be said to be
made up of it, metaphor indeed being the common
coin of discourse. Of imaginary creatures, none
out of the pale of mythology and the East are
equal, perhaps, in point of invention, to Shakespeare&#8217;s
Ariel and Caliban; though poetry may
grudge to prose the discovery of a Winged Woman,
especially such as she has been described by her
inventor in the story of <i>Peter Wilkins</i>; and in
point of treatment, the Mammon and Jealousy of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Spenser, some of the monsters in Dante, particularly
his Nimrod, his interchangements of
creatures into one another, and (if I am not presumptuous
in anticipating what I think will be the
verdict of posterity) the Witch in Coleridge&#8217;s
<i>Christabel</i>, may rank even with the creations of
Shakespeare. It may be doubted, indeed, whether
Shakespeare had bile and nightmare enough in him
to have thought of such detestable horrors as those
of the interchanging adversaries (now serpent,
now man), or even of the huge, half-blockish
enormity of Nimrod,&mdash;in Scripture, the &#8216;mighty
hunter&#8217; and builder of the tower of Babel,&mdash;in
Dante, a tower of a man in his own person, standing
with some of his brother giants up to the middle
in a pit in hell, blowing a horn to which a thunderclap
is a whisper, and hallooing after Dante and
his guide in the jargon of a lost tongue! The
transformations are too odious to quote: but of
the towering giant we cannot refuse ourselves the
&#8216;fearful joy&#8217; of a specimen. It was twilight,
Dante tells us, and he and his guide Virgil were
silently pacing through one of the dreariest regions
of hell, when the sound of a tremendous horn made
him turn all his attention to the spot from which it
came. He there discovered through the dusk,
what seemed to be the towers of a city. Those are
no towers, said his guide; they are giants, standing
up to the middle in one of these circular pits.</p>

<p>Assuredly it could not have been easy to find
a fiction so uncouthly terrible as this in the hypochondria
of Hamlet. Even his father had evidently
seen no such ghost in the other world. All his
phantoms were in the world he had left. Timon,
Lear, Richard, Brutus, Prospero, Macbeth himself,
none of Shakespeare&#8217;s men had, in fact, any thought
but of the earth they lived on, whatever supernatural
fancy crossed them. The thing fancied was
still a thing of this world, &#8216;in its habit as it lived,&#8217;
or no remoter acquaintance than a witch or a fairy.
Its lowest depths (unless Dante suggested them)
were the cellars under the stage. Caliban himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
is a cross-breed between a witch and a clown. No
offence to Shakespeare; who was not bound to be
the greatest of healthy poets, and to have every
morbid inspiration besides. What he might have
done, had he set his wits to compete with Dante,
I know not: all I know is, that in the infernal line
he did nothing like him; and it is not to be wished
he had. It is far better that, as a higher, more
universal, and more beneficent variety of the genus
Poet, he should have been the happier man he was,
and left us the plump cheeks on his monument,
instead of the carking visage of the great, but over-serious,
and comparatively one-sided Florentine.
Even the imagination of Spenser, whom we take
to have been a &#8216;nervous gentleman&#8217; compared with
Shakespeare, was visited with no such dreams as
Dante. Or, if it was, he did not choose to make
himself thinner (as Dante says <i>he</i> did) with dwelling
upon them. He had twenty visions of nymphs
and bowers, to one of the mud of Tartarus.
Chaucer, for all he was &#8216;a man of this world&#8217; as
well as the poets&#8217; world, and as great, perhaps
a greater enemy of oppression than Dante, besides
being one of the profoundest masters of pathos that
ever lived, had not the heart to conclude the story
of the famished father and his children, as finished
by the inexorable anti-Pisan. But enough of
Dante in this place. Hobbes, in order to daunt
the reader from objecting to his friend Davenant&#8217;s
want of invention, says of these fabulous creations
in general, in his letter prefixed to the poem of
<i>Gondibert</i>, that &#8216;impenetrable armours, enchanted
castles, invulnerable bodies, iron men, flying horses,
and a thousand other such things, are easily feigned
by them that dare&#8217;. These are girds at Spenser<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
and Ariosto. But, with leave of Hobbes (who
translated Homer as if on purpose to show what
execrable verses could be written by a philosopher),
enchanted castles and flying horses are not easily
feigned as Ariosto and Spenser feigned them;
and that just makes all the difference. For proof,
see the accounts of Spenser&#8217;s enchanted castle in
Book the Third, Canto Twelfth, of the <i>Faerie
Queene</i>; and let the reader of Italian open the
<i>Orlando Furioso</i> at its first introduction of the
Hippogriff (Canto iii, st. 4), where Bradamante,
coming to an inn, hears a great noise, and sees all
the people looking up at something in the air;
upon which, looking up herself, she sees a knight
in shining armour riding towards the sunset upon
a creature with variegated wings, and then dipping
and disappearing among the hills. Chaucer&#8217;s
steed of brass, that was</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So horsly and so quick of eye,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">is copied from the life. You might pat him and
feel his brazen muscles. Hobbes, in objecting to
what he thought childish, made a childish mistake.
His criticism is just such as a boy might pique
himself upon, who was educated on mechanical
principles, and thought he had outgrown his Goody
Two-shoes. With a wonderful dimness of discernment
in poetic matters, considering his acuteness
in others, he fancies he has settled the question by
pronouncing such creations &#8216;impossible&#8217;! To the
brazier they are impossible, no doubt; but not to
the poet. Their possibility, if the poet wills it,
is to be conceded; the problem is, the creature
being given, how to square its actions with probability,
according to the nature assumed of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Hobbes did not see, that the skill and beauty of
these fictions lay in bringing them within those
very regions of truth and likelihood in which he
thought they could not exist. Hence the serpent
Python of Chaucer,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Sleeping against the sun upon a day,</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">when Apollo slew him. Hence the chariot-drawing
dolphins of Spenser, softly swimming along the
shore lest they should hurt themselves against
the stones and gravel. Hence Shakespeare&#8217;s Ariel,
living under blossoms, and riding at evening on the
bat; and his domestic namesake in the <i>Rape of the
Lock</i> (the imagination of the drawing-room) saving
a lady&#8217;s petticoat from the coffee with his plumes,
and directing atoms of snuff into a coxcomb&#8217;s nose.
In the <i>Orlando Furioso</i> (Canto xv, st. 65) is a wild
story of a cannibal necromancer, who laughs at
being cut to pieces, coming together again like
quicksilver, and picking up his head when it is cut
off, sometimes by the hair, sometimes by the nose!
This, which would be purely childish and ridiculous
in the hands of an inferior poet, becomes interesting,
nay grand, in Ariosto&#8217;s, from the beauties of his
style, and its conditional truth to nature. The
monster has a fated hair on his head,&mdash;a single hair,&mdash;which
must be taken from it before he can be
killed. Decapitation itself is of no consequence,
without that proviso. The Paladin Astolfo, who
has fought this phenomenon on horseback, and
succeeded in getting the head and galloping off
with it, is therefore still at a loss what to be at.
How is he to discover such a needle in such a bottle
of hay? The trunk is spurring after him to recover
it, and he seeks for some evidence of the hair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
in vain. At length he bethinks him of scalping
the head. He does so; and the moment the
operation arrives at the place of the hair, <i>the face
of the head becomes pale, the eyes turn in their sockets</i>,
and the lifeless pursuer tumbles from his horse.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then grew the visage pale, and deadly wet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eyes turn&#8217;d in their sockets, drearily;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all things show&#8217;d the villain&#8217;s sun was set.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His trunk that was in chase, fell from its horse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And giving the last shudder, was a corse.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">It is thus, and thus only, by making Nature his
companion wherever he goes, even in the most
supernatural region, that the poet, in the words of
a very instructive phrase, takes the world along
with him. It is true, he must not (as the Platonists
would say) humanize weakly or mistakenly in that
region; otherwise he runs the chance of forgetting
to be true to the supernatural itself, and so betraying
a want of imagination from that quarter. His
nymphs will have no taste of their woods and
waters; his gods and goddesses be only so many
fair or frowning ladies and gentlemen, such as we
see in ordinary paintings; he will be in no danger
of having his angels likened to a sort of wild-fowl,
as Rembrandt has made them in his Jacob&#8217;s
Dream. His Bacchuses will never remind us, like
Titian&#8217;s, of the force and fury, as well as of the
graces, of wine. His Jupiter will reduce no
females to ashes; his fairies be nothing fantastical;
his gnomes not &#8216;of the earth, earthy&#8217;. And this
again will be wanting to Nature; for it will be
wanting to the supernatural, as Nature would have
made it, working in a supernatural direction.
Nevertheless, the poet, even for imagination&#8217;s sake,
must not become a bigot to imaginative truth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
dragging it down into the region of the mechanical
and the limited, and losing sight of its paramount
privilege, which is to make beauty, in a human
sense, the lady and queen of the universe. He
would gain nothing by making his ocean-nymphs
mere fishy creatures, upon the plea that such only
could live in the water: his wood-nymphs with
faces of knotted oak; his angels without breath
and song, because no lungs could exist between the
earth&#8217;s atmosphere and the empyrean. The
Grecian tendency in this respect is safer than the
Gothic; nay, more imaginative; for it enables us
to imagine <i>beyond</i> imagination, and to bring all
things healthily round to their only present final
ground of sympathy,&mdash;the human. When we go
to heaven, we may idealize in a superhuman mode,
and have altogether different notions of the beautiful;
but till then we must be content with the
loveliest capabilities of earth. The sea-nymphs of
Greece were still beautiful women, though they
lived in the water. The gills and fins of the ocean&#8217;s
natural inhabitants were confined to their lowest
semi-human attendants; or if Triton himself was
not quite human, it was because be represented
the fiercer part of the vitality of the seas, as they
did the fairer.</p>

<p>To conclude this part of my subject, I will quote
from the greatest of all narrative writers two
passages;&mdash;one exemplifying the imagination
which brings supernatural things to bear on earthly,
without confounding them; the other, that which
paints events and circumstances after real life.
The first is where Achilles, who has long absented
himself from the conflict between his countrymen
and the Trojans, has had a message from heaven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
bidding him reappear in the enemy&#8217;s sight, standing
outside the camp-wall upon the trench, but doing
nothing more; that is to say, taking no part in the
fight. He is simply to be seen. The two armies
down by the sea-side are contending which shall
possess the body of Patroclus; and the mere sight
of the dreadful Grecian chief&mdash;supernaturally
indeed impressed upon them, in order that nothing
may be wanting to the full effect of his courage and
conduct upon courageous men&mdash;is to determine the
question. We are to imagine a slope of ground
towards the sea, in order to elevate the trench; the
camp is solitary; the battle (&#8216;a dreadful roar of
men,&#8217; as Homer calls it) is raging on the sea-shore;
and the goddess Iris has just delivered her message,
and disappeared.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p class="noin">Of course there is no further question about the
body of Patroclus. It is drawn out of the press,
and received by the awful hero with tears.</p>

<p>The other passage is where Priam, kneeling
before Achilles, and imploring him to give up the
dead body of Hector, reminds him of his own father;
who, whatever (says the poor old king) may be his
troubles with his enemies, has the blessing of
knowing that his son is still alive, and may daily
hope to see him return. Achilles, in accordance
with the strength and noble honesty of the passions
in those times, weeps aloud himself at this appeal,
feeling, says Homer, &#8216;desire&#8217; for his father in his
very &#8216;limbs&#8217;. He joins in grief with the venerable
sufferer, and can no longer withstand the look of
&#8216;his grey head and his grey <i>chin</i>&#8217;. Observe the
exquisite introduction of this last word. It paints
the touching fact of the chin&#8217;s being imploringly
thrown upward by the kneeling old man, and the
very motion of his beard as he speaks.</p>

<span class="i0">Him also, and his borders find no help,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet when he hears that thou art still alive,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To see his dear son coming back from Troy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I, bereav&#8217;d old Priam! I had once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brave sons in Troy, and now I cannot say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That one is left me. Fifty children had I,<br /></span>

<p>O lovely and immortal privilege of genius!
that can stretch its hand out of the wastes of time,
thousands of years back, and touch our eyelids
with tears. In these passages there is not a word
which a man of the most matter-of-fact understanding
might not have written, <i>if he had thought
of it</i>. But in poetry, feeling and imagination are
necessary to the perception and presentation even
of matters of fact. They, and they only, see what
is proper to be told, and what to be kept back;
what is pertinent, affecting, and essential. Without
feeling, there is a want of delicacy and distinction;
without imagination, there is no true
embodiment. In poets, even good of their kind,
but without a genius for narration, the action
would have been encumbered or diverted with
ingenious mistakes. The over-contemplative would
have given us too many remarks; the over-lyrical,
a style too much carried away; the over-fanciful,
conceits and too many similes; the unimaginative,
the facts without the feeling, and not even those.
We should have been told nothing of the &#8216;grey
chin&#8217;, of the house hearing them as they moaned,
or of Achilles gently putting the old man aside;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
much less of that yearning for his father, which
made the hero tremble in every limb. Writers
without the greatest passion and power do not feel
in this way, nor are capable of expressing the
feeling; though there is enough sensibility and
imagination all over the world to enable mankind
to be moved by it, when the poet strikes his truth
into their hearts.</p>

<p>The reverse of imagination is exhibited in pure
absence of ideas, in commonplaces, and, above all,
in conventional metaphor, or such images and their
phraseology as have become the common property
of discourse and writing. Addison&#8217;s <i>Cato</i> is full of
them.</p>

nerve&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;copying a bright example&#8217;; in short, the
whole play, relieved now and then with a smart
sentence or turn of words. The following is
a pregnant example of plagiarism and weak writing.
It is from another tragedy of Addison&#8217;s time&mdash;the
<i>Mariamne</i> of Fenton:</p>

<span class="i4">Mariamne, <i>with superior charms</i>,<br /></span>

<p>&#8216;Triumphing o&#8217;er reason&#8217; is an old acquaintance
of everybody&#8217;s. &#8216;Paradise in her look&#8217; is from
the Italian poets through Dryden. &#8216;Fair as the
first idea&#8217;, &amp;c., is from Milton, spoilt;&mdash;&#8216;winning
grace&#8217; and &#8216;steps&#8217; from Milton and Tibullus, both
spoilt. Whenever beauties are stolen by such
a writer, they are sure to be spoilt: just as when
a great writer borrows, he improves.</p>

<p>To come now to Fancy,&mdash;she is a younger sister
of Imagination, without the other&#8217;s weight of
thought and feeling. Imagination indeed, purely
so called, is all feeling; the feeling of the subtlest
and most affecting analogies; the perception of
sympathies in the natures of things, or in their
popular attributes. Fancy is a sporting with their
resemblance, real or supposed, and with airy and
fantastical creations.</p>

<i>Rape of the Lock</i>, of fancy: <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, the
<i>Tempest</i>, the <i>Faerie Queene</i>, and the <i>Orlando Furioso</i>,
of both. The terms were formerly identical, or
used as such; and neither is the best that might be
found. The term Imagination is too confined:
often too material. It presents too invariably
the idea of a solid body;&mdash;of &#8216;images&#8217; in the sense
of the plaster-cast cry about the streets. Fancy,
on the other hand, while it means nothing but
a spiritual image or apparition (&#934;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#956;&#945;, appearance,
<i>phantom</i>), has rarely that freedom from
visibility which is one of the highest privileges of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
imagination. Viola, in <i>Twelfth Night</i>, speaking
of some beautiful music, says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It gives a very echo to the seat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Love is throned.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">In this charming thought, fancy and imagination
are combined; yet the fancy, the assumption of
Love&#8217;s sitting on a throne, is the image of a solid
body; while the imagination, the sense of sympathy
between the passion of love and impassioned
music, presents us no image at all. Some new
term is wanting to express the more spiritual sympathies
of what is called Imagination.</p>

<p>One of the teachers of Imagination is Melancholy;
and like Melancholy, as Albert Durer has painted
her, she looks out among the stars, and is busied
with spiritual affinities and the mysteries of the
universe. Fancy turns her sister&#8217;s wizard instruments
into toys. She takes a telescope in her hand,
and puts a mimic star on her forehead, and sallies
forth as an emblem of astronomy. Her tendency
is to the child-like and sportive. She chases
butterflies, while her sister takes flight with angels.
She is the genius of fairies, of gallantries, of
fashions; of whatever is quaint and light, showy
and capricious; of the poetical part of wit. She
adds wings and feelings to the images of wit; and
delights as much to people nature with smiling
ideal sympathies, as wit does to bring antipathies
together, and make them strike light on absurdity.
Fancy, however, is not incapable of sympathy with
Imagination. She is often found in her company;
always, in the case of the greatest poets;
often in that of less, though with them she is the
greater favourite. Spenser has great imagination
and fancy too, but more of the latter; Milton both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
also, the very greatest, but with imagination predominant;
Chaucer, the strongest imagination of
real life, beyond any writers but Homer, Dante,
and Shakespeare, and in comic painting inferior
to none; Pope has hardly any imagination, but
he has a great deal of fancy; Coleridge little fancy,
but imagination exquisite. Shakespeare alone, of
all poets that ever lived, enjoyed the regard of both
in equal perfection. A whole fairy poem of his
writing [the Oberon-Titania scenes from the
<i>Midsummer-Night&#8217;s Dream</i>] will be found in the
present volume.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> See also his famous description

<p>Of fancy, so full of gusto as to border on imagination,
Sir John Suckling, in his <i>Ballad on a Wedding</i>,
has given some of the most playful and charming
specimens in the language. They glance like
twinkles of the eye, or cherries bedewed:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Her feet beneath her petticoat,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Like little mice stole in and out,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>As if they fear&#8217;d the light:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But oh! she dances such a way!<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>No sun upon an Easter day</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1">Is half so fine a sight.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">It is very daring, and has a sort of playful grandeur,
to compare a lady&#8217;s dancing with the sun. But as
the sun has it all to himself in the heavens, so she,
in the blaze of her beauty, on earth. This is
imagination fairly displacing fancy. The following
has enchanted everybody:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her lips were red, <i>and one was thin</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Compared with that was next her chin,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Some bee had stung it newly</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Every reader has stolen a kiss at that lip, gay or
grave.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>With regard to the principle of Variety in
Uniformity by which verse ought to be modulated,
and oneness of impression diversely produced, it
has been contended by some, that Poetry need not
be written in verse at all; that prose is as good
a medium, provided poetry be conveyed through
it; and that to think otherwise is to confound
letter with spirit, or form with essence. But the
opinion is a prosaical mistake. Fitness and unfitness
for <i>song</i>, or metrical excitement, just make
all the difference between a poetical and prosaical
subject; and the reason why verse is necessary to
the form of poetry, is, that the perfection of poetical
spirit demands it;&mdash;that the circle of its enthusiasm,
beauty and power, is incomplete without it.
I do not mean to say that a poet can never show
himself a poet in prose; but that, being one, his
desire and necessity will be to write in verse; and
that, if he were unable to do so, he would not, and
could not, deserve his title. Verse to the true poet
is no clog. It is idly called a trammel and a difficulty.
It is a help. It springs from the same
enthusiasm as the rest of his impulses, and is
necessary to their satisfaction and effect. Verse
is no more a clog than the condition of rushing
upward is a clog to fire, or than the roundness and
order of the globe we live on is a clog to the freedom
and variety that abound within its sphere. Verse
is no dominator over the poet, except inasmuch as
the bond is reciprocal, and the poet dominates over
the verse. They are lovers, playfully challenging
each other&#8217;s rule, and delighted equally to rule and
to obey. Verse is the final proof to the poet that
his mastery over his art is complete. It is the
shutting up of his powers in &#8216;<i>measureful</i> content&#8217;;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
the answer of form to his spirit; of strength and
ease to his guidance. It is the willing action, the
proud and fiery happiness, of the winged steed on
whose back he has vaulted,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To witch the world with wondrous horsemanship.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Verse, in short, is that finishing, and rounding,
and &#8216;tuneful planetting&#8217; of the poet&#8217;s creations,
which is produced of necessity by the smooth
tendencies of their energy or inward working, and
the harmonious dance into which they are attracted
round the orb of the beautiful. Poetry, in its complete
sympathy with beauty, must, of necessity,
leave no sense of the beautiful, and no power over
its forms, unmanifested; and verse flows as inevitably
from this condition of its integrity, as
other laws of proportion do from any other kind
of embodiment of beauty (say that of the human
figure), however free and various the movements
may be that play within their limits. What great
poet ever wrote his poems in prose? or where is
a good prose poem, of any length, to be found?
The poetry of the Bible is understood to be in verse,
in the original. Mr. Hazlitt has said a good word
for those prose enlargements of some fine old song,
which are known by the name of Ossian; and in
passages they deserve what he said; but he
judiciously abstained from saying anything about
the form. Is Gesner&#8217;s <i>Death of Abel</i> a poem? or
Hervey&#8217;s <i>Meditations</i>? The <i>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</i>
has been called one; and, undoubtedly, Bunyan
had a genius which tended to make him a poet, and
one of no mean order: and yet it was of as ungenerous
and low a sort as was compatible with so
lofty an affinity; and this is the reason why it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
stopped where it did. He had a craving after the
beautiful, but not enough of it in himself to echo
to its music. On the other hand, the possession of
the beautiful will not be sufficient without force
to utter it. The author of <i>Telemachus</i> had a soul
full of beauty and tenderness. He was not a man
who, if he had had a wife and children, would have
run away from them, as Bunyan&#8217;s hero did, to get
a place by himself in heaven. He was &#8216;a little
lower than the angels&#8217;, like our own Bishop Jewells
and Berkeleys; and yet he was no poet. He was
too delicately, not to say feebly, absorbed in his
devotions, to join in the energies of the seraphic
choir.</p>

<p>Every poet, then, is a versifier; every fine poet
an excellent one; and he is the best whose verse
exhibits the greatest amount of strength, sweetness,
straightforwardness, unsuperfluousness, <i>variety</i>, and
<i>oneness</i>;&mdash;oneness, that is to say, consistency, in
the general impression, metrical and moral; and
variety, or every pertinent diversity of tone and
rhythm, in the process. <i>Strength</i> is the muscle of
verse, and shows itself in the number and force
of the marked syllables; as,</p>

<p>Weakness in versification is want of accent and
emphasis. It generally accompanies prosaicalness,
and is the consequence of weak thoughts, and of
the affectation of a certain well-bred enthusiasm.
The writings of the late Mr. Hayley were remarkable
for it; and it abounds among the lyrical imitators
of Cowley, and the whole of what is called our
French school of poetry, when it aspired above
its wit and &#8216;sense&#8217;. It sometimes breaks down in
a horrible, hopeless manner, as if giving way at the
first step. The following ludicrous passage in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Congreve, intended to be particularly fine, contains
an instance:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">And lo! Silence himself is here;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Methinks I see the midnight god appear.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In all his downy pomp array&#8217;d,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Behold the reverend shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>An ancient sigh he sits upon!!!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose memory of sound is long since gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And purposely annihilated for his throne!!!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>Ode on the singing of Mrs. Arabella Hunt.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>See also the would-be enthusiasm of Addison
about music:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">For ever consecrate the <i>day</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2">To music and <i>Cecilia</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Music, the greatest good that mortals know,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all of heaven we have below,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Music can noble <small>HINTS</small> <i>impart!!!</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is observable that the unpoetic masters of ridicule
are apt to make the most ridiculous mistakes,
when they come to affect a strain higher than the
one they are accustomed to. But no wonder.
Their habits neutralize the enthusiasm it requires.</p>

<p><i>Sweetness</i>, though not identical with smoothness,
any more than feeling is with sound, always includes
it; and smoothness is a thing so little to be
regarded for its own sake, and indeed so worthless
in poetry but for some taste of sweetness, that I have
not thought necessary to mention it by itself;
though such an all-in-all in versification was it
regarded not a hundred years back, that Thomas
Warton himself, an idolater of Spenser, ventured
to wish the following line in the <i>Faerie Queene</i>,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And was admir&egrave;d much of fools, <i>w&ograve;men</i>, and boys&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">altered to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And was admir&egrave;d much of women, fools, and boys&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">thus destroying the fine scornful emphasis on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
first syllable of &#8216;women&#8217;! (an ungallant intimation,
by the way, against the fair sex, very startling
in this no less woman-loving than great poet). Any
poetaster can be smooth. Smoothness abounds
in all small poets, as sweetness does in the greater.
Sweetness is the smoothness of grace and delicacy,&mdash;of
the sympathy with the pleasing and lovely.
Spenser is full of it,&mdash;Shakespeare&mdash;Beaumont and
Fletcher&mdash;Coleridge. Of Spenser&#8217;s and Coleridge&#8217;s
versification it is the prevailing characteristic. Its
main secrets are a smooth progression between
variety and sameness, and a voluptuous sense of
the continuous,&mdash;&#8216;linked sweetness long drawn out&#8217;.
Observe the first and last lines of the stanza in the
<i>Faerie Queene</i>, describing a shepherd brushing away
the gnats;&mdash;the open and the close <i>e&#8217;s</i> in the one,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As g&egrave;ntle sh&egrave;pherd in sw&#275;&#275;t &#275;ventide&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">and the repetition of the word <i>oft</i>, and the fall from
the vowel <i>a</i>, into the two <i>u&#8217;s</i> in the other,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She brusheth <i>oft</i>, and <i>oft</i> doth m&agrave;r their m&#363;rm&#365;rings.<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>An abundance of examples from his poetry
will be found in the volume before us. His beauty
revolves on itself with conscious loveliness. And
Coleridge is worthy to be named with him, as the
reader will see also, and has seen already. Let him
take a sample meanwhile from the poem called the
<i>Day Dream</i>! Observe both the variety and sameness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Bend o&#8217;er us, like a bower, my beautiful green willow.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>By <i>Straightforwardness</i> is meant the flow of
words, in their natural order, free alike from
mere prose, and from those inversions to which bad
poets recur in order to escape the charge of prose,
but chiefly to accommodate their rhymes. In
Shadwell&#8217;s play of <i>Psyche</i>, Venus gives the sisters
of the heroine an answer, of which the following
is the <i>entire</i> substance, literally, in so many words.
The author had nothing better for her to say:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I receive your prayers with kindness, and will give
success to your hopes. I have seen, with anger, mankind
adore your sister&#8217;s beauty and deplore her scorn: which
they shall do no more. For I&#8217;ll so resent their idolatry,
as shall content your wishes to the full.</p></div>

<p>Now in default of all imagination, fancy, and
expression, how was the writer to turn these words
into poetry or rhyme? Simply by diverting them
from their natural order, and twisting the halves
of the sentences each before the other.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">With kindness I your prayers receive,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And to your hopes success will give.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have, with anger, seen mankind adore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your sister&#8217;s beauty and her scorn deplore;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Which they shall do no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For their idolatry I&#8217;ll so resent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As shall your wishes to the full content!!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is just as if a man were to allow that there
was no poetry in the words, &#8216;How do you find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
yourself?&#8217; &#8216;Very well, I thank you&#8217;; but to
hold them inspired, if altered into</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yourself how do you find?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Very well, you I thank.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is true, the best writers in Shadwell&#8217;s age were
addicted to these inversions, partly for their own
reasons, as far as rhyme was concerned, and partly
because they held it to be writing in the classical
and Virgilian manner. What has since been called
Artificial Poetry was then flourishing, in contradistinction
to Natural; or Poetry seen chiefly
through art and books, and not in its first sources.
But when the artificial poet partook of the natural,
or, in other words, was a true poet after his kind,
his best was always written in his most natural
and straightforward manner. Hear Shadwell&#8217;s
antagonist Dryden. Not a particle of inversion,
beyond what is used for the sake of emphasis in
common discourse, and this only in one line (the
last but three), is to be found in his immortal
character of the Duke of Buckingham:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A man so various, that he seemed to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not one, but all mankind&#8217;s epitome:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stiff in opinions, <i>always in the wrong</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Was everything by starts, and nothing long;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in the course of one revolving moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was chemist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then all for women, rhyming, dancing, drinking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Blest madman!</i> who could every hour employ<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>With something new to wish or to enjoy!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Railing and praising were his usual themes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And both, to show his judgement, in extremes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So over violent, or over civil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That every man with him was god or devil.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In squandering wealth was his peculiar art;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nothing went unrewarded, but desert.</i><br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Beggar&#8217;d by fools, whom still he found too late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He had his jest, and they had his estate.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Inversion itself was often turned into a grace
in these poets, and may be in others, by the power
of being superior to it; using it only with a classical
air, and as a help lying next to them, instead of
a salvation which they are obliged to seek. In
jesting passages also it sometimes gave the rhyme
a turn agreeably wilful, or an appearance of choosing
what lay in its way; as if a man should pick
up a stone to throw at another&#8217;s head, where a less
confident foot would have stumbled over it. Such
is Dryden&#8217;s use of the word <i>might</i>&mdash;the mere sign
of a tense&mdash;in his pretended ridicule of the monkish
practice of rising to sing psalms in the night.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">To sacred rites; and vex th&#8217; ethereal powers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With midnight matins at uncivil hours;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay more, his quiet neighbours should molest<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Just in the sweetness of their morning rest.</i><br /></span>

<p class="noin">(What a line full of &#8216;another doze&#8217; is that!)</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Beast of a bird!</i> supinely, when he <i>might</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0">What if his dull forefathers used that cry?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could he not let a bad example die?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I the more gladly quote instances like those of
Dryden, to illustrate the points in question, because
they are specimens of the very highest kind of
writing in the heroic couplet upon subjects not
heroical. As to prosaicalness in general, it is
sometimes indulged in by young writers on the
plea of its being natural; but this is a mere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
confusion of triviality with propriety, and is usually
the result of indolence.</p>

<p><i>Unsuperfluousness</i> is rather a matter of style
in general, than of the sound and order of words:
and yet versification is so much strengthened by
it, and so much weakened by its opposite, that
it could not but come within the category of its
requisites. When superfluousness of words is not
occasioned by overflowing animal spirits, as in
Beaumont and Fletcher, or by the very genius of
luxury, as in Spenser (in which cases it is enrichment
as well as overflow), there is no worse sign for
a poet altogether, except pure barrenness. Every
word that could be taken away from a poem, unreferable
to either of the above reasons for it, is
a damage; and many such are death; for there
is nothing that posterity seems so determined to
resent as this want of respect for its time and
trouble. The world is too rich in books to endure
it. Even true poets have died of this Writer&#8217;s
Evil. Trifling ones have survived, with scarcely
any pretensions but the terseness of their trifles.
What hope can remain for wordy mediocrity?
Let the discerning reader take up any poem, pen in
hand, for the purpose of discovering how many words
he can strike out of it that give him no requisite
ideas, no relevant ones that he cares for, and no
reasons for the rhyme beyond its necessity, and he
will see what blot and havoc he will make in many
an admired production of its day,&mdash;what marks of
its inevitable fate. Bulky authors in particular,
however safe they may think themselves, would
do well to consider what parts of their cargo they
might dispense with in their proposed voyage down
the gulfs of time; for many a gallant vessel, thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
indestructible in its age, has perished;&mdash;many
a load of words, expected to be in eternal demand,
gone to join the wrecks of self-love, or rotted in
the warehouses of change and vicissitude. I have
said the more on this point, because in an age
when the true inspiration has undoubtedly been
reawakened by Coleridge and his fellows, and we
have so many new poets coming forward, it may be
as well to give a general warning against that
tendency to an accumulation and ostentation of
<i>thoughts</i>, which is meant to be a refutation in full
of the pretensions of all poetry less cogitabund,
whatever may be the requirements of its class.
Young writers should bear in mind, that even some
of the very best materials for poetry are not poetry
built; and that the smallest marble shrine, of
exquisite workmanship, outvalues all that architect
ever chipped away. Whatever can be so dispensed
with is rubbish.</p>

<p><i>Variety</i> in versification consists in whatsoever
can be done for the prevention of monotony, by
diversity of stops and cadences, distribution of
emphasis, and retardation and acceleration of
time; for the whole real secret of versification is
a musical secret, and is not attainable to any vital
effect, save by the ear of genius. All the mere
knowledge of feet and numbers, of accent and
quantity, will no more impart it, than a knowledge
of the &#8216;Guide to Music&#8217; will make a Beethoven
or a Paisiello. It is a matter of sensibility and
imagination; of the beautiful in poetical passion,
accompanied by musical; of the imperative
necessity for a pause here, and a cadence there, and
a quicker or slower utterance in this or that place,
created by analogies of sound with sense, by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
fluctuations of feeling, by the demands of the gods
and graces that visit the poet&#8217;s harp, as the winds
visit that of Aeolus. The same time and quantity
which are occasioned by the spiritual part of this
secret, thus become its formal ones,&mdash;not feet and
syllables, long and short, iambics or trochees;
which are the reduction of it to its <i>less</i> than dry
bones. You might get, for instance, not only ten
and eleven, but thirteen or fourteen syllables into
a rhyming, as well as blank, heroical verse, if time
and the feeling permitted; and in irregular measure
this is often done; just as musicians put twenty
notes in a bar instead of two, quavers instead of
minims, according as the feeling they are expressing
impels them to fill up the time with short and
hurried notes, or with long; or as the choristers
in a cathedral retard or precipitate the words of
the chant, according as the quantity of its notes,
and the colon which divides the verse of the psalm,
conspire to demand it. Had the moderns borne
this principle in mind when they settled the prevailing
systems of verse, instead of learning them,
as they appear to have done, from the first drawling
and one-syllabled notation of the church hymns,
we should have retained all the advantages of the
more numerous versification of the ancients, without
being compelled to fancy that there was no
alternative for us between our syllabical uniformity
and the hexameters or other special forms unsuited
to our tongues. But to leave this question alone,
we will present the reader with a few sufficing
specimens of the difference between monotony and
variety in versification, first from Pope, Dryden,
and Milton, and next from Gay and Coleridge.
The following is the boasted melody of the nevertheless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
exquisite poet of the <i>Rape of the Lock</i>,&mdash;exquisite
in his wit and fancy, though not in his
numbers. The reader will observe that it is
literally <i>see-saw</i>, like the rising and falling of
a plank, with a light person at one end who is
jerked up in the briefer time, and a heavier one
who is set down more leisurely at the other. It
is in the otherwise charming description of the
heroine of that poem:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On her white breast&mdash;a sparkling cross she wore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Jews might kiss&mdash;and infidels adore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her lively looks&mdash;a sprightly mind disclose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quick as her eyes&mdash;and as unfix&#8217;d as those;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Favours to none&mdash;to all she smiles extends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft she rejects&mdash;but never once offends;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright as the sun&mdash;her eyes the gazers strike,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like the sun&mdash;they shine on all alike;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet graceful ease&mdash;and sweetness void of pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might hide her faults&mdash;if belles had faults to hide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If to her share&mdash;some female errors fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look on her face&mdash;and you&#8217;ll forget them all.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Compare with this the description of Iphigenia
in one of Dryden&#8217;s stories from Boccaccio:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It happen&#8217;d&mdash;on a summer&#8217;s holiday,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That to the greenwood shade&mdash;he took his way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Cymon shunn&#8217;d the church&mdash;and used not much to pray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His quarter-staff&mdash;which he could ne&#8217;er forsake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hung half before&mdash;and half behind his back;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He trudg&#8217;d along&mdash;not knowing what he sought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whistled as he went&mdash;for want of thought.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">By chance conducted&mdash;or by thirst constrain&#8217;d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deep recesses of a grove he gain&#8217;d:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where&mdash;in a plain defended by a wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crept through the matted grass&mdash;a crystal flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By which&mdash;an alabaster fountain stood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the margent of the fount was laid&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attended by her slaves&mdash;a sleeping maid;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Like Dian and her nymphs&mdash;when, tir&#8217;d with sport,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rest by cool Eurotas they resort.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dame herself&mdash;the goddess well express&#8217;d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not more distinguished by her purple vest&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than by the charming features of the face&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And e&#8217;en in slumber&mdash;a superior grace:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her comely limbs&mdash;compos&#8217;d with decent care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her body shaded&mdash;by a light cymar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her bosom to the view&mdash;was only bare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where two beginning paps were scarcely spied&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For yet their places were but signified.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fanning wind upon her bosom blows&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet the fanning wind&mdash;the bosom rose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fanning wind&mdash;and purling stream&mdash;continue her repose.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For a further variety take, from the same
author&#8217;s <i>Theodore and Honoria</i>, a passage in which
the couplets are run one into the other, and all of
it modulated, like the former, according to the
feeling demanded by the occasion:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whilst listening to the murmuring leaves he stood&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than a mile immers&#8217;d within the wood&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once the wind was laid.|&mdash;The whispering sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was dumb.|&mdash;A rising earthquake rock&#8217;d the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With deeper brown the grove was overspread&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sudden horror seiz&#8217;d his giddy head&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his ears tinkled&mdash;and his colour fled.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nature was in alarm.&mdash;Some danger nigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seem&#8217;d threaten&#8217;d&mdash;though unseen to mortal eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unus&#8217;d to fear&mdash;he summon&#8217;d all his soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stood collected in himself&mdash;and whole:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not long.&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But for a crowning specimen of variety of pause
and accent, apart from emotion, nothing can surpass
the account, in <i>Paradise Lost</i>, of the Devil&#8217;s
search for an accomplice:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>If the reader cast his eye again over this passage,
he will not find a verse in it which is not varied and
harmonized in the most remarkable manner. Let
him notice in particular that curious balancing of
the lines in the sixth and tenth verses:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>In</i> with the river sunk, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Up</i> beyond the river <i>Ob</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It might, indeed, be objected to the versification
of Milton, that it exhibits too constant a perfection
of this kind. It sometimes forces upon us too
great a sense of consciousness on the part of the
composer. We miss the first sprightly runnings of
verse,&mdash;the ease and sweetness of spontaneity.
Milton, I think, also too often condenses weight
into heaviness.</p>

<p>Thus much concerning the chief of our two
most popular measures. The other, called octo-syllabic,
or the measure of eight syllables, offered
such facilities for <i>namby-pamby</i>, that it had become
a jest as early as the time of Shakespeare, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
makes Touchstone call it the &#8216;butterwoman&#8217;s rate
to market&#8217;, and the &#8216;very false gallop of verses&#8217;.
It has been advocated, in opposition to the heroic
measure, upon the ground that ten syllables lead
a man into epithets and other superfluities, while
eight syllables compress him into a sensible and
pithy gentleman. But the heroic measure laughs
at it. So far from compressing, it converts one line
into two, and sacrifices everything to the quick
and importunate return of the rhyme. With
Dryden, compare Gay, even in the strength of
Gay,&mdash;</p>

<p>Coleridge saw the mistake which had been made
with regard to this measure, and restored it to the
beautiful freedom of which it was capable, by calling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
to mind the liberties allowed its old musical professors
the minstrels, and dividing it by <i>time</i> instead
of <i>syllables</i>;&mdash;by the <i>beat of four</i> into which you
might get as many syllables as you could, instead of
allotting eight syllables to the poor time, whatever
it might have to say. He varied it further with
alternate rhymes and stanzas, with rests and
omissions precisely analogous to those in music,
and rendered it altogether worthy to utter the
manifold thoughts and feelings of himself and his
lady Christabel. He even ventures, with an
exquisite sense of solemn strangeness and licence
(for there is witchcraft going forward), to introduce
a couplet of blank verse, itself as mystically and
beautifully modulated as anything in the music of
Gluck or Weber.</p>

<p>The principle of Variety in Uniformity is here
worked out in a style &#8216;beyond the reach of art&#8217;.
Everything is diversified according to the demand
of the moment, of the sounds, the sights, the
emotions; the very uniformity of the outline is
gently varied; and yet we feel that <i>the whole is
one and of the same character</i>, the single and sweet
unconsciousness of the heroine making all the rest
seem more conscious, and ghastly, and expectant.
It is thus that <i>versification itself becomes part of the
sentiment of a poem</i>, and vindicates the pains that
have been taken to show its importance. I know
of no very fine versification unaccompanied with
fine poetry; no poetry of a mean order accompanied
with verse of the highest.</p>

<p>As to Rhyme, which might be thought too
insignificant to mention, it is not at all so. The
universal consent of modern Europe, and of the
East in all ages, has made it one of the musical
beauties of verse for all poetry but epic and
dramatic, and even for the former with Southern
Europe,&mdash;a sustainment for the enthusiasm, and
a demand to enjoy. The mastery of it consists in
never writing it for its own sake, or at least never
appearing to do so; in knowing how to vary it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
to give it novelty, to render it more or less strong,
to divide it (when not in couplets) at the proper
intervals, to repeat it many times where luxury
or animal spirits demand it (see an instance in
Titania&#8217;s speech to the Fairies), to impress an
affecting or startling remark with it, and to make
it, in comic poetry, a new and surprising addition
to the jest.</p>

<p class="noin">The sweepingness of the assumption completes the
flowing breadth of effect.</p>

<p>Dryden confessed that a rhyme often gave him
a thought. Probably the happy word &#8216;sprung&#8217;
in the following passage from Ben Jonson was
suggested by it; but then the poet must have had
the feeling in him.</p>

<p>Boileau&#8217;s trick for appearing to rhyme naturally
was to compose the second line of his couplet first!
which gives one the crowning idea of the &#8216;artificial
school of poetry&#8217;. Perhaps the most perfect
master of rhyme, the easiest and most abundant,
was the greatest writer of comedy that the world
has seen,&mdash;Moli&egrave;re.</p>

<p>If a young reader should ask, after all, What is
the quickest way of knowing bad poets from good,
the best poets from the next best, and so on? the
answer is, the only and twofold way: first, the
perusal of the best poets with the greatest attention;
and, second, the cultivation of that love of
truth and beauty which made them what they are.
Every true reader of poetry partakes a more than
ordinary portion of the poetic nature; and no one
can be completely such, who does not love, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
take an interest in, everything that interests the
poet, from the firmament to the daisy,&mdash;from
the highest heart of man to the most pitiable of
the low. It is a good practice to read with pen in
hand, marking what is liked or doubted. It rivets
the attention, realizes the greatest amount of enjoyment,
and facilitates reference. It enables the
reader also, from time to time, to see what progress
he makes with his own mind, and how it grows up
towards the stature of its exalter.</p>

<p>If the same person should ask, What class of
poetry is the highest? I should say, undoubtedly,
the Epic; for it includes the drama, with narration
besides; or the speaking and action of the characters,
with the speaking of the poet himself, whose
utmost address is taxed to relate all well for so long
a time, particularly in the passages least sustained
by enthusiasm. Whether this class has included
the greatest poet, is another question still under
trial; for Shakespeare perplexes all such verdicts,
even when the claimant is Homer; though, if
a judgement may be drawn from his early narratives
(<i>Venus and Adonis</i>, and the <i>Rape of Lucrece</i>), it is to
be doubted whether even Shakespeare could have
told a story like Homer, owing to that incessant
activity and superfoetation of thought, a little less
of which might be occasionally desired even in his
plays;&mdash;if it were possible, once possessing anything
of his, to wish it away. Next to Homer and
Shakespeare come such narrators as the less
universal, but still intenser Dante; Milton, with
his dignified imagination; the universal, profoundly
simple Chaucer; and luxuriant, remote Spenser&mdash;immortal
child in poetry&#8217;s most poetic solitudes:
then the great second-rate dramatists; unless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
those who are better acquainted with Greek tragedy
than I am, demand a place for them before Chaucer:
then the airy yet robust universality of Ariosto;
the hearty, out-of-door nature of Theocritus, also
a universalist; the finest lyrical poets (who only
take short flights, compared with the narrators);
the purely contemplative poets who have more
thought than feeling; the descriptive, satirical,
didactic, epigrammatic. It is to be borne in mind,
however, that the first poet of an inferior class may
be superior to followers in the train of a higher one,
though the superiority is by no means to be taken
for granted; otherwise Pope would be superior to
Fletcher, and Butler to Pope. Imagination, teeming
with action and character, makes the greatest
poets; feeling and thought the next; fancy (by
itself) the next; wit the last. Thought by itself
makes no poet at all; for the mere conclusions of
the understanding can at best be only so many
intellectual matters of fact. Feeling, even destitute
of conscious thought, stands a far better poetical
chance; feeling being a sort of thought without
the process of thinking,&mdash;a grasper of the truth
without seeing it. And what is very remarkable,
feeling seldom makes the blunders that thought
does. An idle distinction has been made between
taste and judgement. Taste is the very maker of
judgement. Put an artificial fruit in your mouth,
or only handle it, and you will soon perceive the
difference between judging from taste or tact, and
judging from the abstract figment called judgement.
The latter does but throw you into guesses
and doubts. Hence the conceits that astonish
us in the gravest, and even subtlest, thinkers,
whose taste is not proportionate to their mental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
perceptions; men like Donne, for instance; who,
apart from accidental personal impressions, seem to
look at nothing as it really is, but only as to what
may be thought of it. Hence, on the other hand,
the delightfulness of those poets who never violate
truth of feeling, whether in things real or imaginary;
who are always consistent with their object and
its requirements; and who run the great round of
nature, not to perplex and be perplexed, but to
make themselves and us happy. And luckily,
delightfulness is not incompatible with greatness,
willing soever as men may be in their present
imperfect state to set the power to subjugate above
the power to please. Truth, of any great kind
whatsoever, makes great writing. This is the
reason why such poets as Ariosto, though not writing
with a constant detail of thought and feeling
like Dante, are justly considered great as well as
delightful. Their greatness proves itself by the
same truth of nature, and sustained power, though
in a different way. Their action is not so crowded
and weighty; their sphere has more territories less
fertile; but it has enchantments of its own, which
excess of thought would spoil,&mdash;luxuries, laughing
graces, animal spirits; and not to recognize the
beauty and greatness of these, treated as they treat
them, is simply to be defective in sympathy.
Every planet is not Mars or Saturn. There is also
Venus and Mercury. There is one genius of the
south, and another of the north, and others uniting
both. The reader who is too thoughtless or too
sensitive to like intensity of any sort, and he who
is too thoughtful or too dull to like anything but
the greatest possible stimulus of reflection or passion,
are equally wanting in complexional fitness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
for a thorough enjoyment of books. Ariosto occasionally
says as fine things as Dante, and Spenser as
Shakespeare; but the business of both is to enjoy;
and in order to partake their enjoyment to its full
extent, you must feel what poetry is in the general
as well as the particular, must be aware that there
are different songs of the spheres, some fuller of
notes, and others of a sustained delight; and as
the former keep you perpetually alive to thought or
passion, so from the latter you receive a constant
harmonious sense of truth and beauty, more agreeable
perhaps on the whole, though less exciting.
Ariosto, for instance, does not <i>tell a story</i> with the
brevity and concentrated passion of Dante; every
sentence is not so full of matter, nor the style so
removed from the indifference of prose; yet you
are charmed with a truth of another sort, equally
characteristic of the writer, equally drawn from
nature and substituting a healthy sense of enjoyment
for intenser emotion. Exclusiveness of liking
for this or that mode of truth, only shows, either
that a reader&#8217;s perceptions are limited, or that he
would sacrifice truth itself to his favourite form of
it. Sir Walter Raleigh, who was as trenchant
with his pen as his sword, hailed the <i>Faerie Queene</i>
of his friend Spenser in verses in which he said that
&#8216;Petrarch&#8217; was thenceforward to be no more
heard of; and that in all English poetry, there was
nothing he counted &#8216;of any price&#8217; but the effusions
of the new author. Yet Petrarch is still living;
Chaucer was not abolished by Sir Walter; and
Shakespeare is thought somewhat valuable. A
botanist might as well have said, that myrtles and
oaks were to disappear, because acacias had come
up. It is with the poet&#8217;s creations, as with nature&#8217;s,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
great or small. Wherever truth and beauty, whatever
their amount, can be worthily shaped into
verse, and answer to some demand for it in our
hearts, there poetry is to be found; whether in
productions grand and beautiful as some great
event, or some mighty, leafy solitude, or no bigger
and more pretending than a sweet face or a bunch
of violets; whether in Homer&#8217;s epic or Gray&#8217;s
<i>Elegy</i>, in the enchanted gardens of Ariosto and
Spenser, or the very pot-herbs of the <i>Schoolmistress</i>
of Shenstone, the balms of the simplicity of a cottage.
Not to know and feel this, is to be deficient
in the universality of Nature herself, who is a
poetess on the smallest as well as the largest scale,
and who calls upon us to admire all her productions;
not indeed with the same degree of admiration, but
with no refusal of it, except to defect.</p>

<p>I cannot draw this essay towards its conclusion
better than with three memorable words of Milton;
who has said, that poetry, in comparison with
science, is &#8216;simple, sensuous, and passionate&#8217;. By
simple, he means unperplexed and self-evident;
by sensuous, genial and full of imagery; by
passionate, excited and enthusiastic. I am aware
that different constructions have been put on some
of these words; but the context seems to me to
necessitate those before us. I quote, however, not
from the original, but from an extract in the
<i>Remarks on Paradise Lost</i> by Richardson.</p>

<p>What the poet has to cultivate above all things
is love and truth;&mdash;what he has to avoid, like
poison, is the fleeting and the false. He will get no
good by proposing to be &#8216;in earnest at the moment&#8217;.
His earnestness must be innate and habitual;
born with him, and felt to be his most precious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
inheritance. &#8216;I expect neither profit nor general
fame by my writings,&#8217; says Coleridge, in the
Preface to his Poems; &#8216;and I consider myself as
having been amply repaid without either. Poetry
has been to me its &#8220;<i>own exceeding great reward</i>&#8221;;
it has soothed my afflictions; it has multiplied and
refined my enjoyments; it has endeared solitude;
and it has given me the habit of wishing to discover
the good and the beautiful in all that meets
and surrounds me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Poetry&#8217;, says Shelley, &#8216;lifts the veil from the
hidden beauty of the world, <i>and makes familiar
objects be as if they were not familiar</i>. It reproduces
all that it represents; and the impersonations
clothed in its Elysian light stand thenceforward in
the minds of those who have once contemplated
them, as memorials of that gentle and exalted content
which extends itself over all thoughts and
actions with which it co-exists. The great secret
of morals is love, or a going out of our own nature,
and an identification of ourselves with the beautiful
which exists in thought, action, or person, not
our own. A man, to be greatly good, must imagine
intensely and comprehensively; he must put
himself in the place of another, and of many others:
the pains and pleasures of his species must become
his own. The great instrument of moral good is
imagination; and poetry administers to the effect
by acting upon the cause.&#8217;</p>

<p>I would not willingly say anything after perorations
like these; but as treatises on poetry may
chance to have auditors who think themselves
called upon to vindicate the superiority of what is
termed useful knowledge, it may be as well to add,
that if the poet may be allowed to pique himself on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
any one thing more than another, compared with
those who undervalue him, it is on that power of
undervaluing nobody, and no attainments different
from his own, which is given him by the very
faculty of imagination they despise. The greater
includes the less. They do not see that their inability
to comprehend him argues the smaller
capacity. No man recognizes the worth of utility
more than the poet: he only desires that the meaning
of the term may not come short of its greatness,
and exclude the noblest necessities of his fellow-creatures.
He is quite as much pleased, for instance,
with the facilities for rapid conveyance
afforded him by the railroad, as the dullest confiner
of its advantages to that single idea, or as the
greatest two-idea&#8217;d man who varies that single idea
with hugging himself on his &#8216;buttons&#8217; or his good
dinner. But he sees also the beauty of the country
through which he passes, of the towns, of the heavens,
of the steam-engine itself, thundering and fuming
along like a magic horse, of the affections that are
carrying, perhaps, half the passengers on their
journey, nay, of those of the great two-idea&#8217;d man;
and, beyond all this, he discerns the incalculable
amount of good, and knowledge, and refinement,
and mutual consideration, which this wonderful
invention is fitted to circulate over the globe,
perhaps to the displacement of war itself, and
certainly to the diffusion of millions of enjoyments.</p>

<p>&#8216;And a button-maker, after all, invented it!&#8217;
cries our friend.</p>

<p>Pardon me&mdash;it was a nobleman. A button-maker
may be a very excellent, and a very poetical
man too, and yet not have been the first man
visited by a sense of the gigantic powers of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
combination of water and fire. It was a nobleman
who first thought of this most poetical bit of
science. It was a nobleman who first thought of
it&mdash;a captain who first tried it&mdash;and a button-maker
who perfected it. And he who put the
nobleman on such thoughts was the great philosopher,
Bacon, who said that poetry had &#8216;something
divine in it&#8217;, and was necessary to the
satisfaction of the human mind.</p>

<h3>THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY</h3>

<h4>[Preface to &#8216;Poems&#8217;, 1853]</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> two small volumes of Poems, published
anonymously, one in 1849, the other in 1852,
many of the Poems which compose the present
volume have already appeared. The rest are now
published for the first time.</p>

<p>I have, in the present collection, omitted the
Poem from which the volume published in 1852
took its title. I have done so, not because the
subject of it was a Sicilian Greek born between
two and three thousand years ago, although
many persons would think this a sufficient reason.
Neither have I done so because I had, in my own
opinion, failed in the delineation which I intended
to effect. I intended to delineate the feelings of
one of the last of the Greek religious philosophers,
one of the family of Orpheus and Musaeus, having
survived his fellows, living on into a time when
the habits of Greek thought and feeling had begun
fast to change, character to dwindle, the influence
of the Sophists to prevail. Into the feelings of
a man so situated there entered much that we
are accustomed to consider as exclusively modern;
how much, the fragments of Empedocles himself
which remain to us are sufficient at least to indicate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
What those who are familiar only with the great
monuments of early Greek genius suppose to be
its exclusive characteristics, have disappeared; the
calm, the cheerfulness, the disinterested objectivity
have disappeared: the dialogue of the mind with
itself has commenced; modern problems have
presented themselves; we hear already the doubts,
we witness the discouragement, of Hamlet and of
Faust.</p>

<p>The representation of such a man&#8217;s feelings
must be interesting, if consistently drawn. We
all naturally take pleasure, says Aristotle, in any
imitation or representation whatever: this is the
basis of our love of Poetry: and we take pleasure
in them, he adds, because all knowledge is naturally
agreeable to us; not to the philosopher only,
but to mankind at large. Every representation
therefore which is consistently drawn may be
supposed to be interesting, inasmuch as it gratifies
this natural interest in knowledge of all kinds.
What is <i>not</i> interesting, is that which does not
add to our knowledge of any kind; that which is
vaguely conceived and loosely drawn; a representation
which is general, indeterminate, and
faint, instead of being particular, precise, and firm.</p>

<p>Any accurate representation may therefore be
expected to be interesting; but, if the representation
be a poetical one, more than this is demanded.
It is demanded, not only that it shall interest, but
also that it shall inspirit and rejoice the reader:
that it shall convey a charm, and infuse delight.
For the Muses, as Hesiod says, were born that
they might be &#8216;a forgetfulness of evils, and a truce
from cares&#8217;; and it is not enough that the Poet
should add to the knowledge of men, it is required<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
of him also that he should add to their happiness.
&#8216;All Art&#8217;, says Schiller, &#8216;is dedicated to Joy, and
there is no higher and no more serious problem,
than how to make men happy. The right Art is
that alone, which creates the highest enjoyment.&#8217;</p>

<p>A poetical work, therefore, is not yet justified
when it has been shown to be an accurate, and therefore
interesting, representation; it has to be shown
also that it is a representation from which men
can derive enjoyment. In presence of the most
tragic circumstances, represented in a work of Art,
the feeling of enjoyment, as is well known, may
still subsist: the representation of the most utter
calamity, of the liveliest anguish, is not sufficient to
destroy it: the more tragic the situation, the deeper
becomes the enjoyment; and the situation is more
tragic in proportion as it becomes more terrible.</p>

<p>What then are the situations, from the representation
of which, though accurate, no poetical
enjoyment can be derived? They are those in
which the suffering finds no vent in action; in
which a continuous state of mental distress is
prolonged, unrelieved by incident, hope, or resistance;
in which there is everything to be endured,
nothing to be done. In such situations there is
inevitably something morbid, in the description
of them something monotonous. When they
occur in actual life, they are painful, not tragic;
the representation of them in poetry is painful also.</p>

<p>To this class of situations, poetically faulty as
it appears to me, that of Empedocles, as I have
endeavoured to represent him, belongs; and I
have therefore excluded the Poem from the
present collection.</p>

<p>And why, it may be asked, have I entered into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
this explanation respecting a matter so unimportant
as the admission or exclusion of the Poem in
question? I have done so, because I was anxious
to avow that the sole reason for its exclusion was
that which has been stated above; and that it
has not been excluded in deference to the opinion
which many critics of the present day appear to
entertain against subjects chosen from distant
times and countries: against the choice, in short,
of any subjects but modern ones.</p>

<p>&#8216;The Poet,&#8217; it is said, and by an intelligent
critic, &#8216;the Poet who would really fix the public
attention must leave the exhausted past, and
draw his subjects from matters of present import,
and <i>therefore</i> both of interest and novelty.&#8217;</p>

<p>Now this view I believe to be completely false.
It is worth examining, inasmuch as it is a fair
sample of a class of critical dicta everywhere
current at the present day, having a philosophical
form and air, but no real basis in fact; and which
are calculated to vitiate the judgement of readers
of poetry, while they exert, so far as they are
adopted, a misleading influence on the practice of
those who write it.</p>

<p>What are the eternal objects of Poetry, among
all nations and at all times? They are actions;
human actions; possessing an inherent interest
in themselves, and which are to be communicated
in an interesting manner by the art of the Poet.
Vainly will the latter imagine that he has everything
in his own power; that he can make an intrinsically
inferior action equally delightful with a more
excellent one by his treatment of it: he may
indeed compel us to admire his skill, but his work
will possess, within itself, an incurable defect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>The Poet, then, has in the first place to select
an excellent action; and what actions are the
most excellent? Those, certainly, which most
powerfully appeal to the great primary human
affections: to those elementary feelings which
subsist permanently in the race, and which are
independent of time. These feelings are permanent
and the same; that which interests them is
permanent and the same also. The modernness
or antiquity of an action, therefore, has nothing
to do with its fitness for poetical representation;
this depends upon its inherent qualities. To the
elementary part of our nature, to our passions,
that which is great and passionate is eternally
interesting; and interesting solely in proportion
to its greatness and to its passion. A great human
action of a thousand years ago is more interesting
to it than a smaller human action of to-day, even
though upon the representation of this last the
most consummate skill may have been expended,
and though it has the advantage of appealing by
its modern language, familiar manners, and contemporary
allusions, to all our transient feelings
and interests. These, however, have no right to
demand of a poetical work that it shall satisfy
them; their claims are to be directed elsewhere.
Poetical works belong to the domain of our
permanent passions: let them interest these, and
the voice of all subordinate claims upon them is
at once silenced.</p>

<p>Achilles, Prometheus, Clytemnestra, Dido&mdash;what
modern poem presents personages as interesting,
even to us moderns, as these personages of an
&#8216;exhausted past&#8217;? We have the domestic epic
dealing with the details of modern life which pass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
daily under our eyes; we have poems representing
modern personages in contact with the problems
of modern life, moral, intellectual, and social;
these works have been produced by poets the
most distinguished of their nation and time; yet
I fearlessly assert that <i>Hermann and Dorothea</i>,
<i>Childe Harold</i>, <i>Jocelyn</i>, <i>The Excursion</i>, leave the
reader cold in comparison with the effect produced
upon him by the latter books of the Iliad, by the
<i>Orestea</i>, or by the episode of Dido. And why is
this? Simply because in the three latter cases
the action is greater, the personages nobler, the
situations more intense: and this is the true basis
of the interest in a poetical work, and this alone.</p>

<p>It may be urged, however, that past actions
may be interesting in themselves, but that they
are not to be adopted by the modern Poet, because
it is impossible for him to have them clearly
present to his own mind, and he cannot therefore
feel them deeply, nor represent them forcibly.
But this is not necessarily the case. The externals
of a past action, indeed, he cannot know with the
precision of a contemporary; but his business is
with its essentials. The outward man of Oedipus
or of Macbeth, the houses in which they lived, the
ceremonies of their courts, he cannot accurately
figure to himself; but neither do they essentially
concern him. His business is with their inward
man; with their feelings and behaviour in certain
tragic situations, which engage their passions as
men; these have in them nothing local and
casual; they are as accessible to the modern
Poet as to a contemporary.</p>

<p>The date of an action, then, signifies nothing:
the action itself, its selection and construction,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
this is what is all-important. This the Greeks
understood far more clearly than we do. The
radical difference between their poetical theory
and ours consists, as it appears to me, in this:
that, with them, the poetical character of the
action in itself, and the conduct of it, was the first
consideration; with us, attention is fixed mainly
on the value of the separate thoughts and images
which occur in the treatment of an action. They
regarded the whole; we regard the parts. With
them, the action predominated over the expression
of it; with us, the expression predominates over
the action. Not that they failed in expression,
or were inattentive to it; on the contrary, they
are the highest models of expression, the unapproached
masters of the <i>grand style</i>: but their
expression is so excellent because it is so admirably
kept in its right degree of prominence; because it
is so simple and so well subordinated; because it
draws its force directly from the pregnancy of the
matter which it conveys. For what reason was the
Greek tragic poet confined to so limited a range
of subjects? Because there are so few actions
which unite in themselves, in the highest degree,
the conditions of excellence: and it was not
thought that on any but an excellent subject
could an excellent Poem be constructed. A few
actions, therefore, eminently adapted for tragedy,
maintained almost exclusive possession of the
Greek tragic stage; their significance appeared
inexhaustible; they were as permanent problems,
perpetually offered to the genius of every fresh
poet. This too is the reason of what appears to
us moderns a certain baldness of expression in
Greek tragedy; of the triviality with which we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
often reproach the remarks of the Chorus, where
it takes part in the dialogue: that the action
itself, the situation of Orestes, or Merope, or
Alcmaeon, was to stand the central point of
interest, unforgotten, absorbing, principal; that
no accessories were for a moment to distract the
spectator&#8217;s attention from this; that the tone of
the parts was to be perpetually kept down, in
order not to impair the grandiose effect of the whole.
The terrible old mythic story on which the drama
was founded stood, before he entered the theatre,
traced in its bare outlines upon the spectator&#8217;s
mind; it stood in his memory, as a group of
statuary, faintly seen, at the end of a long and
dark vista: then came the Poet, embodying outlines,
developing situations, not a word wasted, not
a sentiment capriciously thrown in; stroke upon
stroke, the drama proceeded: the light deepened
upon the group; more and more it revealed itself
to the riveted gaze of the spectator: until at last,
when the final words were spoken, it stood before
him in broad sunlight, a model of immortal beauty.</p>

<p>This was what a Greek critic demanded; this
was what a Greek poet endeavoured to effect.
It signified nothing to what time an action belonged;
we do not find that the <i>Persae</i> occupied a particularly
high rank among the dramas of Aeschylus, because
it represented a matter of contemporary interest:
this was not what a cultivated Athenian required;
he required that the permanent elements of his
nature should be moved; and dramas of which
the action, though taken from a long-distant
mythic time, yet was calculated to accomplish this
in a higher degree than that of the <i>Persae</i>, stood
higher in his estimation accordingly. The Greeks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
felt, no doubt, with their exquisite sagacity of taste,
that an action of present times was too near them,
too much mixed up with what was accidental
and passing, to form a sufficiently grand, detached,
and self-subsistent object for a tragic poem: such
objects belonged to the domain of the comic poet,
and of the lighter kinds of poetry. For the more
serious kinds, for <i>pragmatic</i> poetry, to use an excellent
expression of Polybius, they were more difficult and
severe in the range of subjects which they permitted.
Their theory and practice alike, the admirable
treatise of Aristotle, and the unrivalled works of
their poets, exclaim with a thousand tongues&mdash;&#8216;All
depends upon the subject; choose a fitting
action, penetrate yourself with the feeling of its
situations; this done, everything else will follow.&#8217;</p>

<p>But for all kinds of poetry alike there was one
point on which they were rigidly exacting; the
adaptability of the subject to the kind of poetry
selected, and the careful construction of the poem.</p>

<p>How different a way of thinking from this is ours!
We can hardly at the present day understand what
Menander meant, when he told a man who inquired
as to the progress of his comedy that he had finished
it, not having yet written a single line, because
he had constructed the action of it in his mind.
A modern critic would have assured him that the
merit of his piece depended on the brilliant things
which arose under his pen as he went along. We
have poems which seem to exist merely for the
sake of single lines and passages; not for the sake
of producing any total impression. We have critics
who seem to direct their attention merely to
detached expressions, to the language about the
action, not to the action itself. I verily think that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
the majority of them do not in their hearts believe
that there is such a thing as a total-impression to
be derived from a poem at all, or to be demanded
from a poet; they think the term a commonplace
of metaphysical criticism. They will permit the
Poet to select any action he pleases, and to suffer
that action to go as it will, provided he gratifies
them with occasional bursts of fine writing, and
with a shower of isolated thoughts and images.
That is, they permit him to leave their poetical
sense ungratified, provided that he gratifies their
rhetorical sense and their curiosity. Of his neglecting
to gratify these, there is little danger; he needs
rather to be warned against the danger of attempting
to gratify these alone; he needs rather to be
perpetually reminded to prefer his action to everything
else; so to treat this, as to permit its inherent
excellences to develop themselves, without interruption
from the intrusion of his personal peculiarities:
most fortunate when he most entirely succeeds
in effacing himself, and in enabling a noble action
to subsist as it did in nature.</p>

<p>But the modern critic not only permits a false
practice; he absolutely prescribes false aims.&mdash;&#8216;A
true allegory of the state of one&#8217;s own mind in
a representative history,&#8217; the Poet is told, &#8216;is
perhaps the highest thing that one can attempt in
the way of poetry.&#8217;&mdash;And accordingly he attempts it.
An allegory of the state of one&#8217;s own mind, the
highest problem of an art which imitates actions!
No assuredly, it is not, it never can be so: no great
poetical work has ever been produced with such
an aim. <i>Faust</i> itself, in which something of
the kind is attempted, wonderful passages as it
contains, and in spite of the unsurpassed beauty of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
the scenes which relate to Margaret, <i>Faust</i> itself,
judged as a whole, and judged strictly as a poetical
work, is defective: its illustrious author, the
greatest poet of modern times, the greatest critic of
all times, would have been the first to acknowledge
it; he only defended his work, indeed, by asserting
it to be &#8216;something incommensurable&#8217;.</p>

<p>The confusion of the present times is great, the
multitude of voices counselling different things
bewildering, the number of existing works capable
of attracting a young writer&#8217;s attention and of
becoming his models, immense: what he wants is
a hand to guide him through the confusion, a voice
to prescribe to him the aim which he should keep in
view, and to explain to him that the value of the
literary works which offer themselves to his attention
is relative to their power of helping him forward on
his road towards this aim. Such a guide the English
writer at the present day will nowhere find. Failing
this, all that can be looked for, all indeed that can
be desired, is, that his attention should be fixed on
excellent models; that he may reproduce, at any
rate, something of their excellence, by penetrating
himself with their works and by catching their
spirit, if he cannot be taught to produce what is
excellent independently.</p>

<p>Foremost among these models for the English
writer stands Shakespeare: a name the greatest
perhaps of all poetical names; a name never to
be mentioned without reverence. I will venture,
however, to express a doubt, whether the influence
of his works, excellent and fruitful for the readers
of poetry, for the great majority, has been of
unmixed advantage to the writers of it. Shakespeare
indeed chose excellent subjects; the world could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
afford no better than Macbeth, or Romeo and Juliet,
or Othello: he had no theory respecting the
necessity of choosing subjects of present import, or
the paramount interest attaching to allegories of
the state of one&#8217;s own mind; like all great poets,
he knew well what constituted a poetical action;
like them, wherever he found such an action, he
took it; like them, too, he found his best in past
times. But to these general characteristics of all
great poets, he added a special one of his own;
a gift, namely, of happy, abundant, and ingenious
expression, eminent and unrivalled: so eminent
as irresistibly to strike the attention first in him,
and even to throw into comparative shade his other
excellences as a poet. Here has been the mischief.
These other excellences were his fundamental
excellences <i>as a poet</i>; what distinguishes the artist
from the mere amateur, says Goethe, is <i>Architectonic&egrave;</i>
in the highest sense; that power of execution,
which creates, forms, and constitutes: not the
profoundness of single thoughts, not the richness of
imagery, not the abundance of illustration. But
these attractive accessories of a poetical work being
more easily seized than the spirit of the whole, and
these accessories being possessed by Shakespeare in
an unequalled degree, a young writer having recourse
to Shakespeare as his model runs great risk of being
vanquished and absorbed by them, and, in consequence,
of reproducing, according to the measure
of his power, these, and these alone. Of this
preponderating quality of Shakespeare&#8217;s genius,
accordingly, almost the whole of modern English
poetry has, it appears to me, felt the influence.
To the exclusive attention on the part of his
imitators to this it is in a great degree owing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
that of the majority of modern poetical works the details
alone are valuable, the composition worthless.
In reading them one is perpetually reminded of that
terrible sentence on a modern French poet&mdash;<i>il dit tout
ce qu&#8217;il veut, mais malheureusement il n&#8217;a rien &agrave; dire</i>.</p>

<p>Let me give an instance of what I mean. I will
take it from the works of the very chief among
those who seem to have been formed in the school
of Shakespeare: of one whose exquisite genius and
pathetic death render him for ever interesting.
I will take the poem of <i>Isabella, or the Pot of Basil</i>,
by Keats. I choose this rather than the <i>Endymion</i>,
because the latter work (which a modern critic
has classed with the <i>Faerie Queene</i>!), although
undoubtedly there blows through it the breath of
genius, is yet as a whole so utterly incoherent, as
not strictly to merit the name of a poem at all.
The poem of <i>Isabella</i>, then, is a perfect treasure-house
of graceful and felicitous words and images:
almost in every stanza there occurs one of those
vivid and picturesque turns of expression, by which
the object is made to flash upon the eye of the
mind, and which thrill the reader with a sudden
delight. This one short poem contains, perhaps,
a greater number of happy single expressions which
one could quote than all the extant tragedies of
Sophocles. But the action, the story? The action
in itself is an excellent one; but so feebly is it
conceived by the Poet, so loosely constructed, that
the effect produced by it, in and for itself, is
absolutely null. Let the reader, after he has
finished the poem of Keats, turn to the same story
in the <i>Decameron</i>: he will then feel how pregnant
and interesting the same action has become in the
hands of a great artist, who above all things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
delineates his object; who subordinates expression
to that which it is designed to express.</p>

<p>I have said that the imitators of Shakespeare,
fixing their attention on his wonderful gift of
expression, have directed their imitation to this,
neglecting his other excellences. These excellences,
the fundamental excellences of poetical art, Shakespeare
no doubt possessed them&mdash;possessed many
of them in a splendid degree; but it may perhaps
be doubted whether even he himself did not sometimes
give scope to his faculty of expression to the
prejudice of a higher poetical duty. For we must
never forget that Shakespeare is the great poet he is
from his skill in discerning and firmly conceiving an
excellent action, from his power of intensely feeling
a situation, of intimately associating himself with
a character; not from his gift of expression, which
rather even leads him astray, degenerating sometimes
into a fondness for curiosity of expression,
into an irritability of fancy, which seems to make
it impossible for him to say a thing plainly, even
when the press of the action demands the very
directest language, or its level character the very
simplest. Mr. Hallam, than whom it is impossible
to find a saner and more judicious critic, has had
the courage (for at the present day it needs courage)
to remark, how extremely and faultily difficult
Shakespeare&#8217;s language often is. It is so: you
may find main scenes in some of his greatest
tragedies, <i>King Lear</i> for instance, where the language
is so artificial, so curiously tortured, and so difficult,
that every speech has to be read two or three
times before its meaning can be comprehended.
This overcuriousness of expression is indeed but
the excessive employment of a wonderful gift&mdash;of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
the power of saying a thing in a happier way than
any other man; nevertheless, it is carried so far
that one understands what M. Guizot meant, when
he said that Shakespeare appears in his language to
have tried all styles except that of simplicity. He
has not the severe and scrupulous self-restraint of
the ancients, partly, no doubt, because he had a far
less cultivated and exacting audience: he has
indeed a far wider range than they had, a far richer
fertility of thought; in this respect he rises above
them: in his strong conception of his subject, in
the genuine way in which he is penetrated with it,
he resembles them, and is unlike the moderns: but
in the accurate limitation of it, the conscientious
rejection of superfluities, the simple and rigorous
development of it from the first line of his work to
the last, he falls below them, and comes nearer to
the moderns. In his chief works, besides what he
has of his own, he has the elementary soundness of
the ancients; he has their important action and
their large and broad manner: but he has not
their purity of method. He is therefore a less safe
model; for what he has of his own is personal, and
inseparable from his own rich nature; it may be
imitated and exaggerated, it cannot be learned or
applied as an art; he is above all suggestive; more
valuable, therefore, to young writers as men than
as artists. But clearness of arrangement, rigour of
development, simplicity of style&mdash;these may to
a certain extent be learned: and these may, I am
convinced, be learned best from the ancients, who,
although infinitely less suggestive than Shakespeare,
are thus, to the artist, more instructive.</p>

<p>What then, it will be asked, are the ancients to
be our sole models? the ancients with their comparatively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
narrow range of experience, and their
widely different circumstances? Not, certainly,
that which is narrow in the ancients, nor that in
which we can no longer sympathize. An action
like the action of the <i>Antigone</i> of Sophocles, which
turns upon the conflict between the heroine&#8217;s duty
to her brother&#8217;s corpse and that to the laws of her
country, is no longer one in which it is possible that
we should feel a deep interest. I am speaking too,
it will be remembered, not of the best sources of
intellectual stimulus for the general reader, but of
the best models of instruction for the individual
writer. This last may certainly learn of the ancients,
better than anywhere else, three things which it
is vitally important for him to know:&mdash;the all-importance
of the choice of a subject; the necessity
of accurate construction; and the subordinate
character of expression. He will learn from them
how unspeakably superior is the effect of the one
moral impression left by a great action treated as
a whole, to the effect produced by the most striking
single thought or by the happiest image. As he
penetrates into the spirit of the great classical works,
as he becomes gradually aware of their intense significance,
their noble simplicity, and their calm pathos,
he will be convinced that it is this effect, unity
and profoundness of moral impression, at which the
ancient Poets aimed; that it is this which constitutes
the grandeur of their works, and which
makes them immortal. He will desire to direct his
own efforts towards producing the same effect.
Above all, he will deliver himself from the jargon
of modern criticism, and escape the danger of producing
poetical works conceived in the spirit of the
passing time, and which partake of its transitoriness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>The present age makes great claims upon us: we
owe it service, it will not be satisfied without our
admiration. I know not how it is, but their
commerce with the ancients appears to me to
produce, in those who constantly practise it,
a steadying and composing effect upon their
judgement, not of literary works only, but of men
and events in general. They are like persons who
have had a very weighty and impressive experience;
they are more truly than others under the empire of
facts, and more independent of the language current
among those with whom they live. They wish
neither to applaud nor to revile their age: they
wish to know what it is, what it can give them, and
whether this is what they want. What they want,
they know very well; they want to educe and
cultivate what is best and noblest in themselves:
they know, too, that this is no easy task&mdash;&#967;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#960;&#8056;&#957;,
as Pittacus said, &#967;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#960;&#8056;&#957; &#7956;&#963;&#952;&#955;&#8056;&#957; &#7956;&#956;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;&#953;&mdash;and
they ask themselves sincerely whether their age
and its literature can assist them in the attempt.
If they are endeavouring to practise any art, they
remember the plain and simple proceedings of the
old artists, who attained their grand results by
penetrating themselves with some noble and
significant action, not by inflating themselves
with a belief in the pre-eminent importance and
greatness of their own times. They do not talk of
their mission, nor of interpreting their age, nor of
the coming Poet; all this, they know, is the mere
delirium of vanity; their business is not to praise
their age, but to afford to the men who live in it the
highest pleasure which they are capable of feeling.
If asked to afford this by means of subjects drawn
from the age itself, they ask what special fitness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
the present age has for supplying them: they are
told that it is an era of progress, an age commissioned
to carry out the great ideas of industrial development
and social amelioration. They reply that with all
this they can do nothing; that the elements they
need for the exercise of their art are great actions,
calculated powerfully and delightfully to affect
what is permanent in the human soul; that so far
as the present age can supply such actions, they
will gladly make use of them; but that an age
wanting in moral grandeur can with difficulty
supply such, and an age of spiritual discomfort
with difficulty be powerfully and delightfully
affected by them.</p>

<p>A host of voices will indignantly rejoin that the
present age is inferior to the past neither in moral
grandeur nor in spiritual health. He who possesses
the discipline I speak of will content himself with
remembering the judgements passed upon the
present age, in this respect, by the two men, the
one of strongest head, the other of widest culture,
whom it has produced; by Goethe and by Niebuhr.
It will be sufficient for him that he knows the
opinions held by these two great men respecting
the present age and its literature; and that he
feels assured in his own mind that their aims and
demands upon life were such as he would wish, at
any rate, his own to be; and their judgement as
to what is impeding and disabling such as he
may safely follow. He will not, however, maintain
a hostile attitude towards the false pretensions of
his age; he will content himself with not being
overwhelmed by them. He will esteem himself
fortunate if he can succeed in banishing from his
mind all feelings of contradiction, and irritation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>,
and impatience; in order to delight himself with
the contemplation of some noble action of a heroic
time, and to enable others, through his representation
of it, to delight in it also.</p>

<p>I am far indeed from making any claim, for
myself, that I possess this discipline; or for the
following Poems, that they breathe its spirit. But
I say, that in the sincere endeavour to learn and
practise, amid the bewildering confusion of our
times, what is sound and true in poetical art,
I seemed to myself to find the only sure guidance,
the only solid footing, among the ancients. They,
at any rate, knew what they wanted in Art, and we
do not. It is this uncertainty which is disheartening,
and not hostile criticism. How often have I felt
this when reading words of disparagement or of
cavil: that it is the uncertainty as to what is really
to be aimed at which makes our difficulty, not the
dissatisfaction of the critic, who himself suffers
from the same uncertainty. <i>Non me tua fervida
terrent Dicta; Dii me terrent, et Jupiter hostis.</i></p>

<p>Two kinds of <i>dilettanti</i>, says Goethe, there are in
poetry: he who neglects the indispensable mechanical
part, and thinks he has done enough if he shows
spirituality and feeling; and he who seeks to arrive
at poetry merely by mechanism, in which he can
acquire an artisan&#8217;s readiness, and is without soul
and matter. And he adds, that the first does most
harm to Art, and the last to himself. If we must
be <i>dilettanti</i>: if it is impossible for us, under the
circumstances amidst which we live, to think
clearly, to feel nobly, and to delineate firmly: if
we cannot attain to the mastery of the great artists&mdash;let
us, at least, have so much respect for our Art
as to prefer it to ourselves: let us not bewilder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
our successors: let us transmit to them the practice
of Poetry, with its boundaries and wholesome
regulative laws, under which excellent works may
again, perhaps, at some future time, be produced,
not yet fallen into oblivion through our neglect,
not yet condemned and cancelled by the influence
of their eternal enemy, Caprice.</p>


<h3 style="padding-top: 1em">ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION</h3>

<h3>(1854)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> allowed the Preface to the former edition
of these Poems to stand almost without change,
because I still believe it to be, in the main, true.
I must not, however, be supposed insensible to the
force of much that has been alleged against portions
of it, or unaware that it contains many things
incompletely stated, many things which need
limitation. It leaves, too, untouched the question,
how far, and in what manner, the opinions there
expressed respecting the choice of subjects apply to
lyric poetry; that region of the poetical field which
is chiefly cultivated at present. But neither have
I time now to supply these deficiencies, nor is this
the proper place for attempting it: on one or two
points alone I wish to offer, in the briefest possible
way, some explanation.</p>

<p>An objection has been ably urged to the classing
together, as subjects equally belonging to a past
time, Oedipus and Macbeth. And it is no doubt
true that to Shakespeare, standing on the verge of
the Middle Ages, the epoch of Macbeth was more
familiar than that of Oedipus. But I was speaking
of actions as they presented themselves to us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
moderns: and it will hardly be said that the
European mind, since Voltaire, has much more
affinity with the times of Macbeth than with those
of Oedipus. As moderns, it seems to me, we have
no longer any direct affinity with the circumstances
and feelings of either; as individuals, we are
attracted towards this or that personage, we have
a capacity for imagining him, irrespective of his
times, solely according to a law of personal sympathy;
and those subjects for which we feel this personal
attraction most strongly, we may hope to treat
successfully. Alcestis or Joan of Arc, Charlemagne
or Agamemnon&mdash;one of these is not really nearer
to us now than another; each can be made present
only by an act of poetic imagination: but this man&#8217;s
imagination has an affinity for one of them, and that
man&#8217;s for another.</p>

<p>It has been said that I wish to limit the Poet, in
his choice of subjects to the period of Greek and
Roman antiquity: but it is not so: I only counsel
him to choose for his subjects great actions, without
regarding to what time they belong. Nor do I deny
that the poetic faculty can and does manifest itself
in treating the most trifling action, the most
hopeless subject. But it is a pity that power
should be wasted; and that the Poet should be
compelled to impart interest and force to his subject,
instead of receiving them from it, and thereby
doubling his impressiveness. There is, it has been
excellently said, an immortal strength in the stories
of great actions: the most gifted poet, then, may
well be glad to supplement with it that mortal
weakness, which, in presence of the vast spectacle
of life and the world, he must for ever feel to be his
individual portion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, with respect to the study of the classical
writers of antiquity: it has been said that we
should emulate rather than imitate them. I make
no objection: all I say is, let us study them. They
can help to cure us of what is, it seems to me, the
great vice of our intellect, manifesting itself in our
incredible vagaries in literature, in art, in religion,
in morals; namely, that it is <i>fantastic</i>, and wants
<i>sanity</i>. Sanity&mdash;that is the great virtue of the
ancient literature: the want of that is the great
defect of the modern, in spite of all its variety and
power. It is impossible to read carefully the great
ancients, without losing something of our caprice
and eccentricity; and to emulate them we must at
least read them.</p>

<h3>OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY</h3>

<h4>[<i>Modern Painters</i>, vol. iii, pt. 4, 1856]</h4>


<p>&sect; 1. <span class="smcap">German</span> dulness, and English affectation,
have of late much multiplied among us the use of
two of the most objectionable words that were ever
coined by the troublesomeness of metaphysicians&mdash;namely,
&#8216;Objective&#8217; and &#8216;Subjective&#8217;.</p>

<p>No words can be more exquisitely, and in all
points, useless; and I merely speak of them that
I may, at once and for ever, get them out of my way,
and out of my reader&#8217;s. But to get that done, they
must be explained.</p>

<p>The word &#8216;Blue&#8217;, say certain philosophers, means
the sensation of colour which the human eye receives
in looking at the open sky, or at a bell gentian.</p>

<p>Now, say they farther, as this sensation can only
be felt when the eye is turned to the object, and as,
therefore, no such sensation is produced by the
object when nobody looks at it, therefore the thing,
when it is not looked at, is not blue; and thus
(say they) there are many qualities of things which
depend as much on something else as on themselves.
To be sweet, a thing must have a taster; it is only
sweet while it is being tasted, and if the tongue had
not the capacity of taste, then the sugar would not
have the quality of sweetness.</p>

<p>And then they agree that the qualities of things
which thus depend upon our perception of them,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
and upon our human nature as affected by them,
shall be called Subjective; and the qualities of
things which they always have, irrespective of any
other nature, as roundness or squareness, shall be
called Objective.</p>

<p>From these ingenious views the step is very easy
to a farther opinion, that it does not much matter
what things are in themselves, but only what they
are to us; and that the only real truth of them is
their appearance to, or effect upon, us. From which
position, with a hearty desire for mystification, and
much egotism, selfishness, shallowness, and impertinence,
a philosopher may easily go so far as to
believe, and say, that everything in the world
depends upon his seeing or thinking of it, and that
nothing, therefore, exists, but what he sees or
thinks of.</p>

<p>&sect; 2. Now, to get rid of all these ambiguities and
troublesome words at once, be it observed that the
word &#8216;Blue&#8217; does <i>not</i> mean the <i>sensation</i> caused by
a gentian on the human eye; but it means the
<i>power</i> of producing that sensation; and this power
is always there, in the thing, whether we are there
to experience it or not, and would remain there though
there were not left a man on the face of the earth.
Precisely in the same way gunpowder has a power
of exploding. It will not explode if you put no
match to it. But it has always the power of so
exploding, and is therefore called an explosive
compound, which it very positively and assuredly is,
whatever philosophy may say to the contrary.</p>

<p>In like manner, a gentian does not produce the
sensation of blueness if you don&#8217;t look at it. But
it has always the power of doing so; its particles
being everlastingly so arranged by its Maker.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
And, therefore, the gentian and the sky are always
verily blue, whatever philosophy may say to the
contrary; and if you do not see them blue when
you look at them, it is not their fault but yours.</p>

<p>&sect; 3. Hence I would say to these philosophers:
If, instead of using the sonorous phrase, &#8216;It is
objectively so,&#8217; you will use the plain old phrase,
&#8216;It <i>is</i> so;&#8217; and if instead of the sonorous phrase,
&#8216;It is subjectively so,&#8217; you will say, in plain old
English, &#8216;It does so,&#8217; or &#8216;It seems so to me;&#8217; you
will, on the whole, be more intelligible to your
fellow-creatures: and besides, if you find that
a thing which generally &#8216;does so&#8217; to other people
(as a gentian looks blue to most men), does <i>not</i> so
to you, on any particular occasion, you will not fall
into the impertinence of saying, that the thing is
not so, or did not so, but you will say simply (what
you will be all the better for speedily finding out),
that something is the matter with you. If you find
that you cannot explode the gunpowder, you will
not declare that all gunpowder is subjective, and
all explosion imaginary, but you will simply suspect
and declare yourself to be an ill-made match.
Which, on the whole, though there may be a distant
chance of a mistake about it, is, nevertheless, the
wisest conclusion you can come to until farther
experiment.</p>

<p>&sect; 4. Now, therefore, putting these tiresome and
absurd words quite out of our way, we may go on
at our ease to examine the point in question&mdash;namely,
the difference between the ordinary, proper,
and true appearances of things to us; and the
extraordinary, or false appearances, when we are
under the influence of emotion, or contemplative
fancy; false appearances, I say, as being entirely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
unconnected with any real power or character in
the object, and only imputed to it by us.</p>

<p>For instance&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The spendthrift crocus, bursting through the mould<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Naked and shivering, with his cup of gold.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is very beautiful, and yet very untrue. The
crocus is not a spendthrift, but a hardy plant; its
yellow is not gold, but saffron. How is it that we
enjoy so much the having it put into our heads that
it is anything else than a plain crocus?</p>

<p>It is an important question. For, throughout our
past reasonings about art, we have always found
that nothing could be good, or useful, or ultimately
pleasurable, which was untrue. But here is something
pleasurable in written poetry which is nevertheless
<i>un</i>true. And what is more, if we think
over our favourite poetry, we shall find it full of
this kind of fallacy, and that we like it all the more
for being so.</p>

<p>&sect; 5. It will appear also, on consideration of the
matter, that this fallacy is of two principal kinds.
Either, as in this case of the crocus, it is the fallacy
of wilful fancy, which involves no real expectation
that it will be believed; or else it is a fallacy caused
by an excited state of the feelings, making us, for
the time, more or less irrational. Of the cheating of
the fancy we shall have to speak presently; but,
in this chapter, I want to examine the nature of
the other error, that which the mind admits when
affected strongly by emotion. Thus, for instance,
in Alton Locke&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They rowed her in across the rolling foam&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cruel, crawling foam.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The foam is not cruel, neither does it crawl.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
The state of mind which attributes to it these
characters of a living creature is one in which the
reason is unhinged by grief. All violent feelings
have the same effect. They produce in us a falseness
in all our impressions of external things, which
I would generally characterize as the &#8216;Pathetic
Fallacy&#8217;.</p>

<p>&sect; 6. Now we are in the habit of considering this
fallacy as eminently a character of poetical description,
and the temper of mind in which we allow it
as one eminently poetical, because passionate.
But, I believe, if we look well into the matter, that
we shall find the greatest poets do not often admit
this kind of falseness&mdash;that it is only the second
order of poets who much delight in it.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus, when Dante describes the spirits falling
from the bank of Acheron &#8216;as dead leaves flutter
from a bough&#8217;, he gives the most perfect image possible
of their utter lightness, feebleness, passiveness,
and scattering agony of despair, without, however,
for an instant losing his own clear perception that
<i>these</i> are souls, and <i>those</i> are leaves; he makes no
confusion of one with the other. But when
Coleridge speaks of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The one red leaf, the last of its clan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That dances as often as dance it can,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">he has a morbid, that is to say, a so far false, idea
about the leaf: he fancies a life in it, and will,
which there are not; confuses its powerlessness
with choice, its fading death with merriment, and
the wind that shakes it with music. Here, however,
there is some beauty, even in the morbid passage;
but take an instance in Homer and Pope. Without
the knowledge of Ulysses, Elpenor, his youngest
follower, has fallen from an upper chamber in the
Circean palace, and has been left dead, unmissed by
his leader, or companions, in the haste of their
departure. They cross the sea to the Cimmerian
land; and Ulysses summons the shades from
Tartarus. The first which appears is that of the
lost Elpenor. Ulysses, amazed, and in exactly the
spirit of bitter and terrified lightness which is seen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>in Hamlet,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> addresses the spirit with the simple,
startled words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Elpenor! How camest thou under the shadowy darkness?
Hast thou come faster on foot than I in my black ship?</p></div>

<p class="noin">Which Pope renders thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O, say, what angry power Elpenor led<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To glide in shades, and wander with the dead?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How could thy soul, by realms and seas disjoined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outfly the nimble sail, and leave the lagging wind?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I sincerely hope the reader finds no pleasure here,
either in the nimbleness of the sail, or the laziness
of the wind! And yet how is it that these conceits
are so painful now, when they have been pleasant
to us in the other instances?</p>

<p>&sect; 7. For a very simple reason. They are not
a <i>pathetic</i> fallacy at all, for they are put into the
mouth of the wrong passion&mdash;a passion which never
could possibly have spoken them&mdash;agonized curiosity.
Ulysses wants to know the facts of the matter; and
the very last thing his mind could do at the moment
would be to pause, or suggest in anywise what was
<i>not</i> a fact. The delay in the first three lines, and
conceit in the last, jar upon us instantly, like the most
frightful discord in music. No poet of true imaginative
power could possibly have written the passage.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p><p>Therefore, we see that the spirit of truth must
guide us in some sort, even in our enjoyment of
fallacy. Coleridge&#8217;s fallacy has no discord in it,
but Pope&#8217;s has set our teeth on edge. Without
farther questioning, I will endeavour to state the
main bearings of this matter.</p>

<p>&sect; 8. The temperament which admits the pathetic
fallacy, is, as I said above, that of a mind and body
in some sort too weak to deal fully with what is
before them or upon them; borne away, or overclouded,
or over-dazzled by emotion; and it is
a more or less noble state, according to the force of
the emotion which has induced it. For it is no
credit to a man that he is not morbid or inaccurate
in his perceptions, when he has no strength of
feeling to warp them; and it is in general a sign of
higher capacity and stand in the ranks of being,
that the emotions should be strong enough to
vanquish, partly, the intellect, and make it believe
what they choose. But it is still a grander condition
when the intellect also rises, till it is strong enough
to assert its rule against, or together with, the
utmost efforts of the passions; and the whole man
stands in an iron glow, white hot, perhaps, but still
strong, and in no wise evaporating; even if he melts,
losing none of his weight.</p>

<p>So, then, we have the three ranks: the man who
perceives rightly, because he does not feel, and to
whom the primrose is very accurately the primrose,
because he does not love it. Then, secondly, the
man who perceives wrongly, because he feels, and
to whom the primrose is anything else than a primrose:
a star, or a sun, or a fairy&#8217;s shield, or a forsaken
maiden. And then, lastly, there is the man who
perceives rightly in spite of his feelings, and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
whom the primrose is for ever nothing else than
itself&mdash;a little flower, apprehended in the very plain
and leafy fact of it, whatever and how many soever
the associations and passions may be, that crowd
around it. And, in general, these three classes
may be rated in comparative order, as the men who
are not poets at all, and the poets of the second
order, and the poets of the first; only however
great a man may be, there are always some subjects
which <i>ought</i> to throw him off his balance; some,
by which his poor human capacity of thought
should be conquered, and brought into the inaccurate
and vague state of perception, so that the language
of the highest inspiration becomes broken, obscure,
and wild in metaphor, resembling that of the
weaker man, overborne by weaker things.</p>

<p>&sect; 9. And thus, in full, there are four classes: the
men who feel nothing, and therefore see truly; the
men who feel strongly, think weakly, and see
untruly (second order of poets); the men who feel
strongly, think strongly, and see truly (first order
of poets); and the men who, strong as human
creatures can be, are yet submitted to influences
stronger than they, and see in a sort untruly,
because what they see is inconceivably above
them. This last is the usual condition of prophetic
inspiration.</p>

<p>&sect; 10. I separate these classes, in order that their
character may be clearly understood; but of course
they are united each to the other by imperceptible
transitions, and the same mind, according to the
influences to which it is subjected, passes at different
times into the various states. Still, the difference
between the great and less man is, on the whole,
chiefly in this point of <i>alterability</i>. That is to say,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
the one knows too much, and perceives and feels
too much of the past and future, and of all things
beside and around that which immediately affects
him, to be in anywise shaken by it. His mind is
made up; his thoughts have an accustomed
current; his ways are steadfast; it is not this or
that new sight which will at once unbalance him.
He is tender to impression at the surface, like a rock
with deep moss upon it; but there is too much
mass of him to be moved. The smaller man, with
the same degree of sensibility, is at once carried off
his feet; he wants to do something he did not
want to do before; he views all the universe in
a new light through his tears; he is gay or enthusiastic,
melancholy or passionate, as things come and
go to him. Therefore the high creative poet might
even be thought, to a great extent, impassive (as
shallow people think Dante stern), receiving indeed
all feelings to the full, but having a great centre of
reflection and knowledge in which he stands serene,
and watches the feeling, as it were, from far off.</p>

<p>Dante, in his most intense moods, has entire
command of himself, and can look around calmly,
at all moments, for the image or the word that will
best tell what he sees to the upper or lower world.
But Keats and Tennyson, and the poets of the
second order, are generally themselves subdued by
the feelings under which they write, or, at least, write
as choosing to be so, and therefore admit certain
expressions and modes of thought which are in
some sort diseased or false.</p>

<p>&sect; 11. Now so long as we see that the <i>feeling</i> is
true, we pardon, or are even pleased by, the confessed
fallacy of sight which it induces: we are pleased,
for instance, with those lines of Kingsley&#8217;s, above<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
quoted, not because they fallaciously describe foam,
but because they faithfully describe sorrow. But
the moment the mind of the speaker becomes cold,
that moment every such expression becomes untrue,
as being for ever untrue in the external facts. And
there is no greater baseness in literature than the
habit of using these metaphorical expressions in
cold blood. An inspired writer, in full impetuosity
of passion, may speak wisely and truly of &#8216;raging
waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame&#8217;;
but it is only the basest writer who cannot speak of
the sea without talking of &#8216;raging waves&#8217;, &#8216;remorseless
floods&#8217;, &#8216;ravenous billows&#8217;, &amp;c.; and it is one of
the signs of the highest power in a writer to check
all such habits of thought, and to keep his eyes
fixed firmly on the <i>pure fact</i>, out of which if any
feeling comes to him or his reader, he knows it must
be a true one.</p>

<p>To keep to the waves, I forget who it is who
represents a man in despair, desiring that his body
may be cast into the sea,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Whose changing mound, and foam that passed away,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might mock the eye that questioned where I lay.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Observe, there is not a single false, or even
overcharged, expression. &#8216;Mound&#8217; of the sea wave
is perfectly simple and true; &#8216;changing&#8217; is as
familiar as may be; &#8216;foam that passed away&#8217;,
strictly literal; and the whole line descriptive of
the reality with a degree of accuracy which I know
not any other verse, in the range of poetry, that
altogether equals. For most people have not
a distinct idea of the clumsiness and massiveness of
a large wave. The word &#8216;wave&#8217; is used too generally
of ripples and breakers, and bendings in light<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
drapery or grass: it does not by itself convey
a perfect image. But the word &#8216;mound&#8217; is heavy,
large, dark, definite; there is no mistaking the kind
of wave meant, nor missing the sight of it. Then
the term &#8216;changing&#8217; has a peculiar force also.
Most people think of waves as rising and falling.
But if they look at the sea carefully, they will
perceive that the waves do not rise and fall. They
change. Change both place and form, but they do
not fall; one wave goes on, and on, and still on;
now lower, now higher, now tossing its mane like
a horse, now building itself together like a wall, now
shaking, now steady, but still the same wave, till
at last it seems struck by something, and changes,
one knows not how,&mdash;becomes another wave.</p>

<p>The close of the line insists on this image, and
paints it still more perfectly,&mdash;&#8216;foam that passed
away&#8217;. Not merely melting, disappearing, but
passing on, out of sight, on the career of the wave.
Then, having put the absolute ocean fact as far as
he may before our eyes, the poet leaves us to feel
about it as we may, and to trace for ourselves the
opposite fact,&mdash;the image of the green mounds that
do not change, and the white and written stones
that do not pass away; and thence to follow out
also the associated images of the calm life with the
quiet grave, and the despairing life with the fading
foam:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let no man move his bones.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As for Samaria, her king is out off like the foam upon the water.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But nothing of this is actually told or pointed out,
and the expressions, as they stand, are perfectly
severe and accurate, utterly uninfluenced by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
firmly governed emotion of the writer. Even the
word &#8216;mock&#8217; is hardly an exception, as it may
stand merely for &#8216;deceive&#8217; or &#8216;defeat&#8217;, without
implying any impersonation of the waves.</p>

<p>&sect; 12. It may be well, perhaps, to give one or two
more instances to show the peculiar dignity possessed
by all passages which thus limit their expression
to the pure fact, and leave the hearer to gather
what he can from it. Here is a notable one from
the Iliad. Helen, looking from the Scaean gate of
Troy over the Grecian host, and telling Priam the
names of its captains, says at last:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I see all the other dark-eyed Greeks; but two I cannot
see,&mdash;Castor and Pollux,&mdash;whom one mother bore with
me. Have they not followed from fair Lacedaemon, or
have they indeed come in their sea-wandering ships, but
now will not enter into the battle of men, fearing the shame
and the scorn that is in Me?</p></div>

<p class="noin">Then Homer:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>So she spoke. But them, already, the life-giving earth
possessed, there in Lacedaemon, in the dear fatherland.</p></div>

<p>Note, here, the high poetical truth carried to the
extreme. The poet has to speak of the earth in
sadness, but he will not let that sadness affect or
change his thoughts of it. No; though Castor and
Pollux be dead, yet the earth is our mother still,
fruitful, life-giving. These are the facts of the thing.
I see nothing else than these. Make what you will
of them.</p>

<p>&sect; 13. Take another very notable instance from
Casimir de la Vigne&#8217;s terrible ballad, <i>La Toilette
de Constance</i>. I must quote a few lines out of it
here and there, to enable the reader who has not
the book by him, to understand its close.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, that is the fact of it. Right or wrong, the
poet does not say. What you may think about it,
he does not know. He has nothing to do with that.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
There lie the ashes of the dead girl in her chamber.
There they danced, till the morning, at the Ambassador&#8217;s
of France. Make what you will of it.</p>

<p>If the reader will look through the ballad, of
which I have quoted only about the third part, he
will find that there is not, from beginning to end
of it, a single poetical (so called) expression, except
in one stanza. The girl speaks as simple prose as
may be; there is not a word she would not have
actually used as she was dressing. The poet stands
by, impassive as a statue, recording her words
just as they come. At last the doom seizes her, and
in the very presence of death, for an instant, his
own emotions conquer him. He records no longer
the facts only, but the facts as they seem to him.
The fire gnaws with <i>voluptuousness&mdash;without pity</i>.
It is soon past. The fate is fixed for ever; and he
retires into his pale and crystalline atmosphere of
truth. He closes all with the calm veracity,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They said, &#8216;Poor Constance!&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&sect; 14. Now in this there is the exact type of the
consummate poetical temperament. For, be it
clearly and constantly remembered, that the
greatness of a poet depends upon the two faculties,
acuteness of feeling, and command of it. A poet is
great, first in proportion to the strength of his passion,
and then, that strength being granted, in proportion
to his government of it; there being, however,
always a point beyond which it would be inhuman
and monstrous if he pushed this government, and,
therefore, a point at which all feverish and wild
fancy becomes just and true. Thus the destruction
of the kingdom of Assyria cannot be contemplated
firmly by a prophet of Israel. The fact is too great,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
too wonderful. It overthrows him, dashes him into
a confused element of dreams. All the world is,
to his stunned thought, full of strange voices.
&#8216;Yea, the fir-trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars
of Lebanon, saying, &#8220;Since thou art gone down to
the grave, no feller is come up against us.&#8221;&#8217; So,
still more, the thought of the presence of Deity
cannot be borne without this great astonishment.
&#8216;The mountains and the hills shall break forth
before you into singing, and all the trees of the field
shall clap their hands.&#8217;</p>

<p>&sect; 15. But by how much this feeling is noble when
it is justified by the strength of its cause, by so
much it is ignoble when there is not cause enough
for it; and beyond all other ignobleness is the mere
affectation of it, in hardness of heart. Simply bad
writing may almost always, as above noticed, be
known by its adoption of these fanciful metaphorical
expressions, as a sort of current coin; yet there is
even a worse, at least a more harmful, condition of
writing than this, in which such expressions are not
ignorantly and feelinglessly caught up, but, by
some master, skilful in handling, yet insincere,
deliberately wrought out with chill and studied
fancy; as if we should try to make an old lava
stream look red-hot again, by covering it with dead
leaves, or white-hot, with hoar-frost.</p>

<p>When Young is lost in veneration, as he dwells on
the character of a truly good and holy man, he
permits himself for a moment to be overborne by
the feeling so far as to exclaim:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where shall I find him? angels, tell me where.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You know him; he is near you; point him out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I see glories beaming from his brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or trace his footsteps by the rising flowers?<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></div></div>

<p>This emotion has a worthy cause, and is thus true
and right. But now hear the cold-hearted Pope say
to a shepherd girl:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where&#8217;er you walk, cool gales shall fan the glade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trees, where you sit, shall crowd into a shade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your praise the birds shall chant in every grove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And winds shall waft it to the powers above.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But would you sing, and rival Orpheus&#8217; strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wondering forests soon should dance again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moving mountains hear the powerful call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And headlong streams hang, listening, in their fall.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is not, nor could it for a moment be mistaken
for, the language of passion. It is simple falsehood,
uttered by hypocrisy; definite absurdity, rooted
in affectation, and coldly asserted in the teeth of
nature and fact. Passion will indeed go far in
deceiving itself; but it must be a strong passion,
not the simple wish of a lover to tempt his mistress
to sing. Compare a very closely parallel passage
in Wordsworth, in which the lover has lost his
mistress:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Three years had Barbara in her grave been laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thus his moan he made:&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Oh move, thou cottage, from behind yon oak,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or let the ancient tree uprooted lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in some other way yon smoke<br /></span>
<span class="i1">May mount into the sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If still behind yon pine-tree&#8217;s ragged bough,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Headlong, the waterfall must come,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Oh, let it, then, be dumb&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be anything, sweet stream, but that which thou art now.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here is a cottage to be moved, if not a mountain,
and a waterfall to be silent, if it is not to hang
listening: but with what different relation to the
mind that contemplates them! Here, in the
extremity of its agony, the soul cries out wildly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
for relief, which at the same moment it partly
knows to be impossible, but partly believes possible,
in a vague impression that a miracle <i>might</i> be wrought
to give relief even to a less sore distress,&mdash;that nature
is kind, and God is kind, and that grief is strong:
it knows not well what <i>is</i> possible to such grief.
To silence a stream, to move a cottage wall,&mdash;one
might think it could do as much as that!</p>

<p>&sect; 16. I believe these instances are enough to
illustrate the main point I insist upon respecting
the pathetic fallacy,&mdash;that so far as it <i>is</i> a fallacy,
it is always the sign of a morbid state of mind, and
comparatively of a weak one. Even in the most
inspired prophet it is a sign of the incapacity of his
human sight or thought to bear what has been
revealed to it. In ordinary poetry, if it is found in
the thoughts of the poet himself, it is at once a sign
of his belonging to the inferior school; if in the
thoughts of the characters imagined by him, it is
right or wrong according to the genuineness of the
emotion from which it springs; always, however,
implying necessarily <i>some</i> degree of weakness in the
character.</p>

<p>Take two most exquisite instances from master
hands. The Jessy of Shenstone, and the Ellen of
Wordsworth, have both been betrayed and deserted.
Jessy, in the course of her most touching complaint,
says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If through the garden&#8217;s flowery tribes I stray,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where bloom the jasmines that could once allure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8216;Hope not to find delight in us,&#8217; they say,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">&#8216;For we are spotless, Jessy; we are pure.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Compare with this some of the words of Ellen:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Ah, why,&#8217; said Ellen, sighing to herself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8216;Why do not words, and kiss, and solemn pledge,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And nature, that is kind in woman&#8217;s breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reason, that in man is wise and good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fear of Him who is a righteous Judge,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why do not these prevail for human life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep two hearts together, that began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their springtime with one love, and that have need<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mutual pity and forgiveness, sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To grant, or be received; while that poor bird&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, come and hear him! Thou who hast to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Been faithless, hear him;&mdash;though a lowly creature,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One of God&#8217;s simple children, that yet know not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Universal Parent, <i>how</i> he sings!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if he wished the firmament of heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should listen, and give back to him the voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his triumphant constancy and love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The proclamation that he makes, how far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His darkness doth transcend our fickle light.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">The perfection of both these passages, as far as
regards truth and tenderness of imagination in the
two poets, is quite insuperable. But, of the two
characters imagined, Jessy is weaker than Ellen,
exactly in so far as something appears to her to be
in nature which is not. The flowers do not really reproach
her. God meant them to comfort her, not to
taunt her; they would do so if she saw them rightly.</p>

<p>Ellen, on the other hand, is quite above the
slightest erring emotion. There is not the barest
film of fallacy in all her thoughts. She reasons as
calmly as if she did not feel. And, although the
singing of the bird suggests to her the idea of its
desiring to be heard in heaven, she does not for an
instant admit any veracity in the thought. &#8216;As if,&#8217;
she says,&mdash;&#8216;I know he means nothing of the kind;
but it does verily seem as if.&#8217; The reader will find,
by examining the rest of the poem, that Ellen&#8217;s
character is throughout consistent in this clear
though passionate strength.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>
<p>It is, I hope, now made clear to the reader in all
respects that the pathetic fallacy is powerful only
so far as it is pathetic, feeble so far as it is fallacious,
and, therefore, that the dominion of Truth is entire,
over this, as over every other natural and just state
of the human mind.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> I admit two orders of poets, but no third; and by these
two orders I mean the Creative (Shakespeare, Homer,
Dante), and Reflective or Perceptive (Wordsworth, Keats,
Tennyson). But both of these must be <i>first</i>-rate in their
range, though their range is different; and with poetry
second-rate in <i>quality</i> no one ought to be allowed to trouble
mankind. There is quite enough of the best,&mdash;much more
than we can ever read or enjoy in the length of a life; and
it is a literal wrong or sin in any person to encumber us with
inferior work. I have no patience with apologies made by
young pseudo-poets, &#8216;that they believe there is <i>some</i> good
in what they have written: that they hope to do better in
time,&#8217; &amp;c. <i>Some</i> good! If there is not <i>all</i> good, there is
no good. If they ever hope to do better, why do they
trouble us now? Let them rather courageously burn all
they have done, and wait for the better days. There are
few men, ordinarily educated, who in moments of strong
feeling could not strike out a poetical thought, and afterwards
polish it so as to be presentable. But men of sense
know better than so to waste their time; and those who
sincerely love poetry, know the touch of the master&#8217;s hand
on the chords too well to fumble among them after him.
Nay, more than this; all inferior poetry is an injury to the
good, inasmuch as it takes away the freshness of rhymes,
blunders upon and gives a wretched commonalty to good
thoughts; and, in general, adds to the weight of human
weariness in a most woful and culpable manner. There
are few thoughts likely to come across ordinary men, which
have not already been expressed by greater men in the best
possible way; and it is a wiser, more generous, more noble
thing to remember and point out the perfect words, than
to invent poorer ones, wherewith to encumber temporarily
the world.</p></div>

<h3>THOUGHTS ON POETRY AND ITS
VARIETIES (1859)</h3>


<h4 style="padding-top: 1em">I</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has often been asked, What is Poetry? And
many and various are the answers which have been
returned. The vulgarest of all&mdash;one with which
no person possessed of the faculties to which Poetry
addresses itself can ever have been satisfied&mdash;is
that which confounds poetry with metrical composition:
yet to this wretched mockery of a definition,
many have been led back, by the failure of all
their attempts to find any other that would distinguish
what they have been accustomed to call
poetry, from much which they have known only
under other names.</p>

<p>That, however, the word &#8216;poetry&#8217; imports something
quite peculiar in its nature, something which
may exist in what is called prose as well as in verse,
something which does not even require the instrument
of words, but can speak through the other
audible symbols called musical sounds, and even
through the visible ones which are the language
of sculpture, painting, and architecture; all this,
we believe, is and must be felt, though perhaps
indistinctly, by all upon whom poetry in any of
its shapes produces any impression beyond that of
tickling the ear. The distinction between poetry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
and what is not poetry, whether explained or not,
is felt to be fundamental: and where every one
feels a difference, a difference there must be. All
other appearances may be fallacious, but the
appearance of a difference is a real difference.
Appearances too, like other things, must have
a cause, and that which can cause anything, even
an illusion, must be a reality. And hence, while
a half-philosophy disdains the classifications and
distinctions indicated by popular language, philosophy
carried to its highest point frames new ones,
but rarely sets aside the old, content with correcting
and regularizing them. It cuts fresh channels for
thought, but does not fill up such as it finds ready-made;
it traces, on the contrary, more deeply,
broadly, and distinctly, those into which the
current has spontaneously flowed.</p>

<p>Let us then attempt, in the way of modest
inquiry, not to coerce and confine nature within
the bounds of an arbitrary definition, but rather to
find the boundaries which she herself has set, and
erect a barrier round them; not calling mankind
to account for having misapplied the word &#8216;poetry&#8217;,
but attempting to clear up the conception which they
already attach to it, and to bring forward as a distinct
principle that which, as a vague feeling, has
really guided them in their employment of the term.</p>

<p>The object of poetry is confessedly to act upon
the emotions; and therein is poetry sufficiently
distinguished from what Wordsworth affirms to be
its logical opposite, namely, not prose, but matter
of fact or science. The one addresses itself to the
belief, the other to the feelings. The one does its
work by convincing or persuading, the other by
moving. The one acts by presenting a proposition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
to the understanding, the other by offering interesting
objects of contemplation to the sensibilities.</p>

<p>This, however, leaves us very far from a definition
of poetry. This distinguishes it from one thing,
but we are bound to distinguish it from everything.
To bring thoughts or images before the mind for the
purpose of acting upon the emotions, does not
belong to poetry alone. It is equally the province
(for example) of the novelist: and yet the faculty
of the poet and that of the novelist are as distinct
as any other two faculties; as the faculties of the
novelist and of the orator, or of the poet and the
metaphysician. The two characters may be
united, as characters the most disparate may; but
they have no natural connexion.</p>

<p>Many of the greatest poems are in the form of
fictitious narratives, and in almost all good serious
fictions there is true poetry. But there is a radical
distinction between the interest felt in a story as
such, and the interest excited by poetry; for the
one is derived from incident, the other from the
representation of feeling. In one, the source of
the emotion excited is the exhibition of a state or
states of human sensibility; in the other, of a series
of states of mere outward circumstances. Now, all
minds are capable of being affected more or less by
representations of the latter kind, and all, or almost
all, by those of the former; yet the two sources of
interest correspond to two distinct, and (as respects
their greatest development) mutually exclusive,
characters of mind.</p>

<p>At what age is the passion for a story, for almost
any kind of story, merely as a story, the most
intense? In childhood. But that also is the age
at which poetry, even of the simplest description, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
least relished and least understood; because the
feelings with which it is especially conversant are
yet undeveloped, and not having been even in the
slightest degree experienced, cannot be sympathized
with. In what stage of the progress of society,
again, is story-telling most valued, and the story-teller
in greatest request and honour?&mdash;In a rude
state like that of the Tartars and Arabs at this day,
and of almost all nations in the earliest ages. But
in this state of society there is little poetry except
ballads, which are mostly narrative, that is, essentially
stories, and derive their principal interest
from the incidents. Considered as poetry, they are
of the lowest and most elementary kind: the
feelings depicted, or rather indicated, are the
simplest our nature has; such joys and griefs as
the immediate pressure of some outward event excites
in rude minds, which live wholly immersed
in outward things, and have never, either from
choice or a force they could not resist, turned themselves
to the contemplation of the world within.
Passing now from childhood, and from the childhood
of society, to the grown-up men and women
of this most grown-up and unchildlike age&mdash;the
minds and hearts of greatest depth and elevation
are commonly those which take greatest delight
in poetry; the shallowest and emptiest, on the
contrary, are, at all events, not those least addicted
to novel-reading. This accords, too, with all
analogous experience of human nature. The sort
of persons whom not merely in books but in their
lives, we find perpetually engaged in hunting for
excitement from without, are invariably those who
do not possess, either in the vigour of their intellectual
powers or in the depth of their sensibilities,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
that which would enable them to find ample excitement
nearer home. The most idle and frivolous
persons take a natural delight in fictitious narrative;
the excitement it affords is of the kind which comes
from without. Such persons are rarely lovers of
poetry, though they may fancy themselves so,
because they relish novels in verse. But poetry,
which is the delineation of the deeper and more
secret workings of human emotion, is interesting
only to those to whom it recalls what they have felt,
or whose imagination it stirs up to conceive what
they could feel, or what they might have been able
to feel, had their outward circumstances been
different.</p>

<p>Poetry, when it is really such, is truth; and
fiction also, if it is good for anything, is truth: but
they are different truths. The truth of poetry is
to paint the human soul truly: the truth of fiction
is to give a true picture of life. The two kinds of
knowledge are different, and come by different ways,
come mostly to different persons. Great poets are
often proverbially ignorant of life. What they
know has come by observation of themselves; they
have found within them one highly delicate and
sensitive specimen of human nature, on which the
laws of emotion are written in large characters,
such as can be read off without much study.
Other knowledge of mankind, such as comes to
men of the world by outward experience, is not
indispensable to them as poets: but to the novelist
such knowledge is all in all; he has to describe
outward things, not the inward man; actions and
events, not feelings; and it will not do for him to be
numbered among those who, as Madame Roland
said of Brissot, know man but not <i>men</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p>All this is no bar to the possibility of combining
both elements, poetry and narrative or incident, in
the same work, and calling it either a novel or
a poem; but so may red and white combine on the
same human features, or on the same canvas.
There is one order of composition which requires
the union of poetry and incident, each in its highest
kind&mdash;the dramatic. Even there the two elements
are perfectly distinguishable, and may exist of
unequal quality, and in the most various proportion.
The incidents of a dramatic poem may be
scanty and ineffective, though the delineation of
passion and character may be of the highest order;
as in Goethe&#8217;s admirable <i>Torquato Tasso</i>; or again,
the story as a mere story may be well got up for
effect, as is the case with some of the most trashy
productions of the Minerva press: it may even
be, what those are not, a coherent and probable
series of events, though there be scarcely a feeling
exhibited which is not represented falsely, or in
a manner absolutely commonplace. The combination
of the two excellences is what renders
Shakespeare so generally acceptable, each sort of
readers finding in him what is suitable to their
faculties. To the many he is great as a story-teller,
to the few as a poet.</p>

<p>In limiting poetry to the delineation of states of
feeling, and denying the name where nothing is
delineated but outward objects, we may be thought
to have done what we promised to avoid&mdash;to have
not found, but made a definition, in opposition to
the usage of language, since it is established by
common consent that there is a poetry called
descriptive. We deny the charge. Description
is not poetry because there is descriptive poetry,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
no more than science is poetry because there is
such a thing as a didactic poem. But an object
which admits of being described, or a truth which
may fill a place in a scientific treatise, may also
furnish an occasion for the generation of poetry,
which we thereupon choose to call descriptive or
didactic. The poetry is not in the object itself, nor
in the scientific truth itself, but in the state of mind
in which the one and the other may be contemplated.
The mere delineation of the dimensions
and colours of external objects is not poetry, no
more than a geometrical ground-plan of St. Peter&#8217;s
or Westminster Abbey is painting. Descriptive
poetry consists, no doubt, in description, but in
description of things as they appear, not as they
are; and it paints them not in their bare and natural
lineaments, but seen through the medium and
arrayed in the colours of the imagination set in
action by the feelings. If a poet describes a lion,
he does not describe him as a naturalist would, nor
even as a traveller would, who was intent upon
stating the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth. He describes him by imagery, that
is, by suggesting the most striking likenesses and
contrasts which might occur to a mind contemplating
the lion, in the state of awe, wonder, or
terror, which the spectacle naturally excites, or is,
on the occasion, supposed to excite. Now this is
describing the lion professedly, but the state of
excitement of the spectator really. The lion may
be described falsely or with exaggeration, and the
poetry be all the better; but if the human emotion
be not painted with scrupulous truth, the poetry
is bad poetry, i. e. is not poetry at all, but a failure.</p>

<p>Thus far our progress towards a clear view of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
essentials of poetry has brought us very close to the
last two attempts at a definition of poetry which we
happen to have seen in print, both of them by poets
and men of genius. The one is by Ebenezer
Elliott, the author of <i>Corn-Law Rhymes</i>, and other
poems of still greater merit. &#8216;Poetry&#8217;, says he,
&#8216;is impassioned truth.&#8217; The other is by a writer
in <i>Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine</i>, and comes, we think,
still nearer the mark. He defines poetry, &#8216;man&#8217;s
thoughts tinged by his feelings&#8217;. There is in
either definition a near approximation to what
we are in search of. Every truth which a human
being can enunciate, every thought, even every
outward impression, which can enter into his consciousness,
may become poetry when shown
through any impassioned medium, when invested
with the colouring of joy, or grief, or pity, or
affection, or admiration, or reverence, or awe, or
even hatred or terror: and, unless so coloured,
nothing, be it as interesting as it may, is poetry.
But both these definitions fail to discriminate
between poetry and eloquence. Eloquence, as well
as poetry, is impassioned truth; eloquence, as well
as poetry, is thoughts coloured by the feelings.
Yet common apprehension and philosophic criticism
alike recognize a distinction between the two:
there is much that every one would call eloquence,
which no one would think of classing as poetry.
A question will sometimes arise, whether some
particular author is a poet; and those who maintain
the negative commonly allow that, though not
a poet, he is a highly eloquent writer. The distinction
between poetry and eloquence appears to
us to be equally fundamental with the distinction
between poetry and narrative, or between poetry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
and description, while it is still farther from having
been satisfactorily cleared up than either of the
others.</p>

<p>Poetry and eloquence are both alike the expression
or utterance of feeling. But if we may be
excused the antithesis, we should say that eloquence
is <i>heard</i>, poetry is <i>over</i>heard. Eloquence
supposes an audience; the peculiarity of poetry
appears to us to lie in the poet&#8217;s utter unconsciousness
of a listener. Poetry is feeling confessing
itself to itself, in moments of solitude, and embodying
itself in symbols which are the nearest possible
representations of the feeling in the exact shape in
which it exists in the poet&#8217;s mind. Eloquence is
feeling pouring itself out to other minds, courting
their sympathy, or endeavouring to influence their
belief or move them to passion or to action.</p>

<p>All poetry is of the nature of soliloquy. It may
be said that poetry which is printed on hot-pressed
paper and sold at a bookseller&#8217;s shop, is a soliloquy
in full dress, and on the stage. It is so; but there
is nothing absurd in the idea of such a mode of
soliloquizing. What we have said to ourselves, we
may tell to others afterwards; what we have said
or done in solitude, we may voluntarily reproduce
when we know that other eyes are upon us. But
no trace of consciousness that any eyes are upon us
must be visible in the work itself. The actor
knows that there is an audience present; but if he
act as though he knew it, he acts ill. A poet may
write poetry not only with the intention of printing
it, but for the express purpose of being paid for it;
that it should <i>be</i> poetry, being written under such
influences, is less probable; not, however, impossible;
but no otherwise possible than if he can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
succeed in excluding from his work every vestige
of such lookings-forth into the outward and every-day
world, and can express his emotions exactly
as he has felt them in solitude, or as he is conscious
that he should feel them though they were to
remain for ever unuttered, or (at the lowest) as
he knows that others feel them in similar circumstances
of solitude. But when he turns round and
addresses himself to another person; when the act
of utterance is not itself the end, but a means to an
end,&mdash;viz. by the feelings he himself expresses, to
work upon the feelings, or upon the belief, or the
will, of another,&mdash;when the expression of his
emotions, or of his thoughts tinged by his emotions,
is tinged also by that purpose, by that desire of
making an impression upon another mind, then it
ceases to be poetry, and becomes eloquence.</p>

<p>Poetry, accordingly, is the natural fruit of solitude
and meditation; eloquence, of intercourse
with the world. The persons who have most
feeling of their own, if intellectual culture has given
them a language in which to express it, have the
highest faculty of poetry; those who best understand
the feelings of others, are the most eloquent.
The persons, and the nations, who commonly excel
in poetry, are those whose character and tastes
render them least dependent upon the applause, or
sympathy, or concurrence of the world in general.
Those to whom that applause, that sympathy, that
concurrence are most necessary, generally excel
most in eloquence. And hence, perhaps, the
French, who are the least poetical of all great and
intellectual nations, are among the most eloquent:
the French, also, being the most sociable, the
vainest, and the least self-dependent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<p>If the above be, as we believe, the true theory
of the distinction commonly admitted between
eloquence and poetry; or even though it be not so,
yet if, as we cannot doubt, the distinction above
stated be a real bona fide distinction, it will be
found to hold, not merely in the language of words,
but in all other language, and to intersect the whole
domain of art.</p>

<p>Take, for example, music: we shall find in that
art, so peculiarly the expression of passion, two perfectly
distinct styles; one of which may be called
the poetry, the other the oratory of music. This
difference, being seized, would put an end to much
musical sectarianism. There has been much contention
whether the music of the modern Italian
school, that of Rossini and his successors, be impassioned
or not. Without doubt, the passion it
expresses is not the musing, meditative tenderness,
or pathos, or grief of Mozart or Beethoven. Yet
it is passion, but garrulous passion&mdash;the passion
which pours itself into other ears; and therein the
better calculated for dramatic effect, having
a natural adaptation for dialogue. Mozart also is
great in musical oratory; but his most touching
compositions are in the opposite style&mdash;that of
soliloquy. Who can imagine &#8216;Dove sono&#8217; <i>heard</i>?
We imagine it <i>over</i>heard.</p>

<p>Purely pathetic music commonly partakes of
soliloquy. The soul is absorbed in its distress, and
though there may be bystanders, it is not thinking
of them. When the mind is looking within, and
not without, its state does not often or rapidly vary;
and hence the even, uninterrupted flow, approaching
almost to monotony, which a good reader, or
a good singer, will give to words or music of a pensive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
or melancholy cast. But grief taking the form of
a prayer, or of a complaint, becomes oratorical; no
longer low, and even, and subdued, it assumes
a more emphatic rhythm, a more rapidly returning
accent; instead of a few slow equal notes, following
one after another at regular intervals, it crowds note
upon note, and often assumes a hurry and bustle like
joy. Those who are familiar with some of the best
of Rossini&#8217;s serious compositions, such as the air
&#8216;Tu che i miseri conforti&#8217;, in the opera of <i>Tancredi</i>,
or the duet &#8216;Ebben per mia memoria&#8217;, in <i>La Gazza
Ladra</i>, will at once understand and feel our meaning.
Both are highly tragic and passionate; the passion
of both is that of oratory, not poetry. The like
may be said of that most moving invocation in
Beethoven&#8217;s <i>Fidelio</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Komm, Hoffnung, lass das letzte Stern<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Der M&uuml;de nicht erbleichen;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">in which Madame Schr&ouml;der Devrient exhibited such
consummate powers of pathetic expression. How
different from Winter&#8217;s beautiful &#8216;Paga fui&#8217;, the
very soul of melancholy exhaling itself in solitude;
fuller of meaning, and, therefore, more profoundly
poetical than the words for which it was composed&mdash;for
it seems to express not simple melancholy, but
the melancholy of remorse.</p>

<p>If, from vocal music, we now pass to instrumental,
we may have a specimen of musical oratory
in any fine military symphony or march: while
the poetry of music seems to have attained its consummation
in Beethoven&#8217;s Overture to Egmont, so
wonderful in its mixed expression of grandeur and
melancholy.</p>

<p>In the arts which speak to the eye, the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
distinctions will be found to hold, not only between
poetry and oratory, but between poetry, oratory,
narrative, and simple imitation or description.</p>

<p>Pure description is exemplified in a mere portrait
or a mere landscape&mdash;productions of art, it is true,
but of the mechanical rather than of the fine arts,
being works of simple imitation, not creation. We
say, a mere portrait, or a mere landscape, because
it is possible for a portrait or a landscape, without
ceasing to be such, to be also a picture; like
Turner&#8217;s landscapes, and the great portraits by
Titian or Vandyke.</p>

<p>Whatever in painting or sculpture expresses
human feeling&mdash;or character, which is only a certain
state of feeling grown habitual&mdash;may be called,
according to circumstances, the poetry, or the
eloquence, of the painter&#8217;s or the sculptor&#8217;s art:
the poetry, if the feeling declares itself by such signs
as escape from us when we are unconscious of being
seen; the oratory, if the signs are those we use for
the purpose of voluntary communication.</p>

<p>The narrative style answers to what is called historical
painting, which it is the fashion among connoisseurs
to treat as the climax of the pictorial art.
That it is the most difficult branch of the art we do
not doubt, because, in its perfection, it includes the
perfection of all the other branches: as in like
manner an epic poem, though in so far as it is epic
(i. e. narrative) it is not poetry at all, is yet esteemed
the greatest effort of poetic genius, because there is
no kind whatever of poetry which may not appropriately
find a place in it. But an historical picture
as such, that is, as the representation of an incident,
must necessarily, as it seems to us, be poor and
ineffective. The narrative powers of painting are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
extremely limited. Scarcely any picture, scarcely
even any series of pictures, tells its own story without
the aid of an interpreter. But it is the single
figures which, to us, are the great charm even of an
historical picture. It is in these that the power of
the art is really seen. In the attempt to narrate,
visible and permanent signs are too far behind the
fugitive audible ones, which follow so fast one after
another, while the faces and figures in a narrative
picture, even though they be Titian&#8217;s, stand still.
Who would not prefer one Virgin and Child of
Raphael, to all the pictures which Rubens, with his
fat, frouzy Dutch Venuses, ever painted? Though
Rubens, besides excelling almost every one in his
mastery over the mechanical parts of his art, often
shows real genius in <i>grouping</i> his figures, the
peculiar problem of historical painting. But then,
who, except a mere student of drawing and colouring,
ever cared to look twice at any of the figures
themselves? The power of painting lies in poetry,
of which Rubens had not the slightest tincture&mdash;not
in narrative, wherein he might have excelled.</p>

<p>The single figures, however, in an historical
picture, are rather the eloquence of painting than
the poetry: they mostly (unless they are quite out
of place in the picture) express the feelings of one
person as modified by the presence of others.
Accordingly the minds whose bent leads them rather
to eloquence than to poetry, rush to historical
painting. The French painters, for instance, seldom
attempt, because they could make nothing of,
single heads, like those glorious ones of the Italian
masters, with which they might feed themselves
day after day in their own Louvre. They must
all be historical; and they are, almost to a man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
attitudinizers. If we wished to give any young
artist the most impressive warning our imagination
could devise against that kind of vice in the pictorial,
which corresponds to rant in the histrionic
art, we would advise him to walk once up and once
down the gallery of the Luxembourg. Every figure
in French painting or statuary seems to be showing
itself off before spectators; they are not poetical,
but in the worst style of corrupted eloquence.</p>


<h4 style="padding-top: 1em">II</h4>

<p><i>Nascitur Poeta</i> is a maxim of classical antiquity,
which has passed to these latter days with less
questioning than most of the doctrines of that early
age. When it originated, the human faculties were
occupied, fortunately for posterity, less in examining
how the works of genius are created, than in
creating them: and the adage, probably, had no
higher source than the tendency common among
mankind to consider all power which is not visibly
the effect of practice, all skill which is not capable
of being reduced to mechanical rules, as the result
of a peculiar gift. Yet this aphorism, born in the
infancy of psychology, will perhaps be found, now
when that science is in its adolescence, to be as true
as an epigram ever is, that is, to contain some truth:
truth, however, which has been so compressed and
bent out of shape, in order to tie it up into so small
a knot of only two words that it requires an almost
infinite amount of unrolling and laying straight,
before it will resume its just proportions.</p>

<p>We are not now intending to remark upon the
grosser misapplications of this ancient maxim,
which have engendered so many races of poetasters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
The days are gone by when every raw youth whose
borrowed phantasies have set themselves to a borrowed
tune, mistaking, as Coleridge says, an ardent
desire of poetic reputation for poetic genius, while
unable to disguise from himself that he had taken
no means whereby he might <i>become</i> a poet, could
fancy himself a born one. Those who would reap
without sowing, and gain the victory without
fighting the battle, are ambitious now of another
sort of distinction, and are born novelists, or public
speakers, not poets. And the wiser thinkers understand
and acknowledge that poetic excellence is
subject to the same necessary conditions with any
other mental endowment; and that to no one of
the spiritual benefactors of mankind is a higher
or a more assiduous intellectual culture needful
than to the poet. It is true, he possesses this advantage
over others who use the &#8216;instrument of words&#8217;,
that, of the truths which he utters, a larger proportion
are derived from personal consciousness, and
a smaller from philosophic investigation. But the
power itself of discriminating between what really
is consciousness, and what is only a process of
inference completed in a single instant&mdash;and the
capacity of distinguishing whether that of which
the mind is conscious be an eternal truth, or but
a dream&mdash;are among the last results of the most
matured and perfect intellect. Not to mention,
that the poet, no more than any other person who
writes, confines himself altogether to intuitive
truths, nor has any means of communicating even
these but by words, every one of which derives all
its power of conveying a meaning, from a whole
host of acquired notions, and facts learnt by study
and experience.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, it seems undeniable in point of
fact, and consistent with the principles of a sound
metaphysics, that there are poetic <i>natures</i>. There
is a mental and physical constitution or temperament,
peculiarly fitted for poetry. This temperament
will not of itself make a poet, no more than the
soil will the fruit; and as good fruit may be raised
by culture from indifferent soils, so may good poetry
from naturally unpoetical minds. But the poetry
of one who is a poet by nature, will be clearly and
broadly distinguishable from the poetry of mere
culture. It may not be truer; it may not be more
useful; but it will be different: fewer will appreciate
it, even though many should affect to do so;
but in those few it will find a keener sympathy, and
will yield them a deeper enjoyment.</p>

<p>One may write genuine poetry, and not be a
poet; for whosoever writes out truly any human
feeling, writes poetry. All persons, even the most
unimaginative, in moments of strong emotion,
speak poetry; and hence the drama is poetry, which
else were always prose, except when a poet is one of
the characters. What <i>is</i> poetry, but the thoughts and
words in which emotion spontaneously embodies
itself? As there are few who are not, at least for
some moments and in some situations, capable of
some strong feeling, poetry is natural to most
persons at some period of their lives. And any one
whose feelings are genuine, though but of the
average strength,&mdash;if he be not diverted by uncongenial
thoughts or occupations from the indulgence
of them, and if he acquire by culture, as all persons
may, the faculty of delineating them correctly,&mdash;has
it in his power to be a poet, so far as a life
passed in writing unquestionable poetry may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
considered to confer that title. But <i>ought</i> it to do
so? Yes, perhaps, in a collection of &#8216;British
Poets&#8217;. But &#8216;poet&#8217; is the name also of a variety
of man, not solely of the author of a particular
variety of book: now, to have written whole
volumes of real poetry is possible to almost all
kinds of characters, and implies no greater peculiarity
of mental construction, than to be the author
of a history, or a novel.</p>

<p>Whom, then, shall we call poets? Those who
are so constituted, that emotions are the links of
association by which their ideas, both sensuous and
spiritual, are connected together. This constitution
belongs (within certain limits) to all in whom
poetry is a pervading principle. In all others,
poetry is something extraneous and superinduced:
something out of themselves, foreign to the habitual
course of their every-day lives and characters;
a world to which they may make occasional visits,
but where they are sojourners, not dwellers, and
which, when out of it, or even when in it, they
think of, peradventure, but as a phantom-world,
a place of <i>ignes fatui</i> and spectral illusions. Those
only who have the peculiarity of association which
we have mentioned, and which is a natural though
not a universal consequence of intense sensibility,
instead of seeming not themselves when they are
uttering poetry, scarcely seem themselves when
uttering anything to which poetry is foreign. Whatever
be the thing which they are contemplating, if
it be capable of connecting itself with their emotions,
the aspect under which it first and most naturally
paints itself to them, is its poetic aspect. The poet
of culture sees his object in prose, and describes it in
poetry; the poet of nature actually sees it in poetry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>This point is perhaps worth some little illustration;
the rather, as metaphysicians (the ultimate
arbiters of all philosophical criticism), while they
have busied themselves for two thousand years,
more or less, about the few <i>universal</i> laws of human
nature, have strangely neglected the analysis of its
<i>diversities</i>. Of these, none lie deeper or reach
further than the varieties which difference of nature
and of education makes in what may be termed the
habitual bond of association. In a mind entirely
uncultivated, which is also without any strong
feelings, objects whether of sense or of intellect
arrange themselves in the mere casual order in
which they have been seen, heard, or otherwise
perceived. Persons of this sort may be said to
think chronologically. If they remember a fact,
it is by reason of a fortuitous coincidence with some
trifling incident or circumstance which took place
at the very time. If they have a story to tell, or
testimony to deliver in a witness-box, their narrative
must follow the exact order in which the events
took place: <i>dodge</i> them, and the thread of association
is broken; they cannot go on. Their associations,
to use the language of philosophers, are
chiefly of the successive, not the synchronous kind,
and whether successive or synchronous, are mostly
casual.</p>

<p>To the man of science, again, or of business,
objects group themselves according to the artificial
classifications which the understanding has voluntarily
made for the convenience of thought or of
practice. But where any of the impressions are
vivid and intense, the associations into which
these enter are the ruling ones: it being a well-known
law of association, that the stronger a feeling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
is, the more quickly and strongly it associates itself
with any other object or feeling. Where, therefore,
nature has given strong feelings, and education
has not created factitious tendencies stronger than
the natural ones, the prevailing associations will be
those which connect objects and ideas with emotions,
and with each other through the intervention
of emotions. Thoughts and images will be linked
together, according to the similarity of the feelings
which cling to them. A thought will introduce
a thought by first introducing a feeling which is
allied with it. At the centre of each group of
thoughts or images will be found a feeling; and
the thoughts or images will be there only because
the feeling was there. The combinations which the
mind puts together, the pictures which it paints,
the wholes which Imagination constructs out of the
materials supplied by Fancy, will be indebted to
some dominant <i>feeling</i>, not as in other natures to
a dominant <i>thought</i>, for their unity and consistency
of character, for what distinguishes them from
incoherencies.</p>

<p>The difference, then, between the poetry of
a poet, and the poetry of a cultivated but not
naturally poetic mind, is, that in the latter, with
however bright a halo of feeling the thought may
be surrounded and glorified, the thought itself is
always the conspicuous object; while the poetry
of a poet is Feeling itself, employing Thought only
as the medium of its expression. In the one, feeling
waits upon thought; in the other, thought upon
feeling. The one writer has a distinct aim, common
to him with any other didactic author; he
desires to convey the thought, and he conveys it
clothed in the feelings which it excites in himself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
or which he deems most appropriate to it. The
other merely pours forth the overflowing of his
feelings; and all the thoughts which those feelings
suggest are floated promiscuously along the stream.</p>

<p>It may assist in rendering our meaning intelligible,
if we illustrate it by a parallel between the
two English authors of our own day who have
produced the greatest quantity of true and enduring
poetry, Wordsworth and Shelley. Apter instances
could not be wished for; the one might be
cited as the type, the <i>exemplar</i>, of what the poetry
of culture may accomplish: the other as perhaps
the most striking example ever known of the poetic
temperament. How different, accordingly, is the
poetry of these two great writers! In Wordsworth,
the poetry is almost always the mere
setting of a thought. The thought may be more
valuable than the setting, or it may be less valuable,
but there can be no question as to which was first
in his mind: what he is impressed with, and what
he is anxious to impress, is some proposition, more
or less distinctly conceived; some truth, or something
which he deems such. He lets the thought
dwell in his mind, till it excites, as is the nature of
thought, other thoughts, and also such feelings as
the measure of his sensibility is adequate to supply.
Among these thoughts and feelings, had he chosen
a different walk of authorship (and there are many
in which he might equally have excelled), he would
probably have made a different selection of media
for enforcing the parent thought: his habits, however,
being those of poetic composition, he selects in
preference the strongest feelings, and the thoughts
with which most of feeling is naturally or habitually
connected. His poetry, therefore, may be defined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
to be, his thoughts, coloured by, and impressing
themselves by means of, emotions. Such poetry,
Wordsworth has occupied a long life in producing.
And well and wisely has he so done. Criticisms,
no doubt, may be made occasionally both upon the
thoughts themselves, and upon the skill he has
demonstrated in the choice of his media: for an
affair of skill and study, in the most rigorous sense,
it evidently was. But he has not laboured in
vain; he has exercised, and continues to exercise,
a powerful, and mostly a highly beneficial influence
over the formation and growth of not a few of the
most cultivated and vigorous of the youthful minds
of our time, over whose heads poetry of the opposite
description would have flown, for want of an
original organization, physical or mental, in sympathy
with it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Wordsworth&#8217;s poetry is
never bounding, never ebullient; has little even of
the appearance of spontaneousness: the well is
never so full that it overflows. There is an air of
calm deliberateness about all he writes, which is
not characteristic of the poetic temperament: his
poetry seems one thing, himself another; he seems
to be poetical because he wills to be so, not because
he cannot help it: did he will to dismiss poetry,
he need never again, it might almost seem, have
a poetical thought. He never seems <i>possessed</i> by
any feeling; no emotion seems ever so strong as to
have entire sway, for the time being, over the
current of his thoughts. He never, even for the
space of a few stanzas, appears entirely given up
to exultation, or grief, or pity, or love, or admiration,
or devotion, or even animal spirits. He now
and then, though seldom, attempts to write as if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
he were: and never, we think, without leaving an
impression of poverty: as the brook which on
nearly level ground quite fills its banks, appears but
a thread when running rapidly down a precipitous
declivity. He has feeling enough to form a decent,
graceful, even beautiful decoration to a thought
which is in itself interesting and moving; but not
so much as suffices to stir up the soul by mere
sympathy with itself in its simplest manifestation,
nor enough to summon up that array of &#8216;thoughts
of power&#8217; which in a richly stored mind always
attends the call of really intense feeling. It is for
this reason, doubtless, that the genius of Wordsworth
is essentially unlyrical. Lyric poetry, as it
was the earliest kind, is also, if the view we are now
taking of poetry be correct, more eminently and
peculiarly poetry than any other: it is the poetry
most natural to a really poetic temperament, and
least capable of being successfully imitated by one
not so endowed by nature.</p>

<p>Shelley is the very reverse of all this. Where
Wordsworth is strong, he is weak; where Wordsworth
is weak, he is strong. Culture, that culture
by which Wordsworth has reared from his own
inward nature the richest harvest ever brought
forth by a soil of so little depth, is precisely what
was wanting to Shelley: or let us rather say, he had
not, at the period of his deplorably early death,
reached sufficiently far in that intellectual progression
of which he was capable, and which, if it
has done so much for greatly inferior natures, might
have made of him the most perfect, as he was
already the most gifted of our poets. For him,
voluntary mental discipline had done little: the
vividness of his emotions and of his sensations had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
done all. He seldom follows up an idea; it starts
into life, summons from the fairy-land of his inexhaustible
fancy some three or four bold images,
then vanishes, and straight he is off on the wings of
some casual association into quite another sphere.
He had scarcely yet acquired the consecutiveness
of thought necessary for a long poem; his more
ambitious compositions too often resemble the
scattered fragments of a mirror; colours brilliant
as life, single images without end, but no picture.
It is only when under the overruling influence of
some one state of feeling, either actually experienced,
or summoned up in the vividness of reality
by a fervid imagination, that he writes as a great
poet; unity of feeling being to him the harmonizing
principle which a central idea is to minds of another
class, and supplying the coherency and consistency
which would else have been wanting. Thus it is in
many of his smaller, and especially his lyrical
poems. They are obviously written to exhale,
perhaps to relieve, a state of feeling, or of conception
of feeling, almost oppressive from its vividness.
The thoughts and imagery are suggested by the
feeling, and are such as it finds unsought. The
state of feeling may be either of soul or of sense, or
oftener (might we not say invariably?) of both:
for the poetic temperament is usually, perhaps
always, accompanied by exquisite senses. The
exciting cause may be either an object or an idea.
But whatever of sensation enters into the feeling,
must not be local, or consciously organic; it is
a condition of the whole frame, not of a part only.
Like the state of sensation produced by a fine
climate, or indeed like all strongly pleasurable or
painful sensations in an impassioned nature, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
pervades the entire nervous system. States of
feeling, whether sensuous or spiritual, which thus
possess the whole being, are the fountains of that
which we have called the poetry of poets; and
which is little else than a pouring forth of the
thoughts and images that pass across the mind while
some permanent state of feeling is occupying it.</p>

<p>To the same original fineness of organization,
Shelley was doubtless indebted for another of his
rarest gifts, that exuberance of imagery, which when
unrepressed, as in many of his poems it is, amounts
to a fault. The susceptibility of his nervous system,
which made his emotions intense, made also
the impressions of his external senses deep and
clear; and agreeably to the law of association by
which, as already remarked, the strongest impressions
are those which associate themselves the most
easily and strongly, these vivid sensations were
readily recalled to mind by all objects or thoughts
which had co-existed with them, and by all feelings
which in any degree resembled them. Never did
a fancy so teem with sensuous imagery as Shelley&#8217;s.
Wordsworth economizes an image, and detains it
until he has distilled all the poetry out of it, and it
will not yield a drop more: Shelley lavishes his
with a profusion which is unconscious because it is
inexhaustible.</p>

<p>If, then, the maxim <i>Nascitur poeta</i> mean, either
that the power of producing poetical compositions
is a peculiar faculty which the poet brings into the
world with him, which grows with his growth like
any of his bodily powers, and is as independent of
culture as his height, and his complexion; or that
any natural peculiarity whatever is implied in
producing poetry, real poetry, and in any quantity&mdash;such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
poetry too, as, to the majority of educated
and intelligent readers, shall appear quite as good
as, or even better than, any other; in either sense
the doctrine is false. And nevertheless, there <i>is</i>
poetry which could not emanate but from a mental
and physical constitution peculiar, not in the kind,
but in the degree of its susceptibility: a constitution
which makes its possessor capable of
greater happiness than mankind in general, and
also of greater unhappiness; and because greater,
so also more various. And such poetry, to all who
know enough of nature to own it as being in nature,
is much more poetry, is poetry in a far higher sense,
than any other; since the common element of all
poetry, that which constitutes poetry, human feeling,
enters far more largely into this than into the
poetry of culture. Not only because the natures
which we have called poetical, really feel more, and
consequently have more feeling to express; but
because, the capacity of feeling being so great,
feeling, when excited and not voluntarily resisted,
seizes the helm of their thoughts, and the succession
of ideas and images becomes the mere utterance of
an emotion; not, as in other natures, the emotion
a mere ornamental colouring of the thought.</p>

<p>Ordinary education and the ordinary course of
life are constantly at work counteracting this
quality of mind, and substituting habits more suitable
to their own ends: if instead of substituting
they were content to superadd, there would be
nothing to complain of. But when will education
consist, not in repressing any mental faculty or
power, from the uncontrolled action of which danger
is apprehended, but in training up to its proper
strength the corrective and antagonist power?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<p>In whomsoever the quality which we have described
exists, and is not stifled, that person is
a poet. Doubtless he is a greater poet in proportion
as the fineness of his perceptions, whether of sense
or of internal consciousness, furnishes him with an
ampler supply of lovely images&mdash;the vigour and
richness of his intellect, with a greater abundance
of moving thoughts. For it is through these
thoughts and images that the feeling speaks, and
through their impressiveness that it impresses
itself, and finds response in other hearts; and from
these media of transmitting it (contrary to the laws
of physical nature) increase of intensity is reflected
back upon the feeling itself. But all these it is
possible to have, and not be a poet; they are mere
materials, which the poet shares in common with
other people. What constitutes the poet is not
the imagery nor the thoughts, nor even the feelings,
but the law according to which they are called up.
He is a poet, not because he has ideas of any
particular kind, but because the succession of big
ideas is subordinate to the course of his emotions.</p>

<p>Many who have never acknowledged this in
theory, bear testimony to it in their particular
judgements. In listening to an oration, or reading
a written discourse not professedly poetical, when
do we begin to feel that the speaker or author is
putting off the character of the orator or the prose
writer, and is passing into the poet? Not when
he begins to show strong feeling; <i>then</i> we merely
say, he is in earnest, he feels what he says; still
less when he expresses himself in imagery; then,
unless illustration be manifestly his sole object, we
are apt to say, this is affectation. It is when the
feeling (instead of passing away, or, if it continue,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
letting the train of thoughts run on exactly as they
would have done if there were no influence at work
but the mere intellect) becomes itself the originator
of another train of association, which expels or
blends with the former; when (for example) either
his words, or the mode of their arrangement, are
such as we spontaneously use only when in a state
of excitement, proving that the mind is at least as
much occupied by a passive state of its own feelings,
as by the desire of attaining the premeditated end
which the discourse has in view.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Our judgements of authors who lay actual claim
to the title of poets, follow the same principle.
Whenever, after a writer&#8217;s meaning is fully understood,
it is still matter of reasoning and discussion
whether he is a poet or not, he will be found to be
wanting in the characteristic peculiarity of association
so often adverted to. When, on the contrary,
after reading or hearing one or two passages, we
instinctively and without hesitation cry out, &#8216;This
is a poet&#8217;, the probability is, that the passages are
strongly marked with this peculiar quality. And
we may add that in such case, a critic who, not
having sufficient feeling to respond to the poetry, is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>also without sufficient philosophy to understand it
though he feel it not, will be apt to pronounce, not
&#8216;this is prose&#8217;, but &#8216;this is exaggeration&#8217;, &#8216;this is
mysticism&#8217;, or, &#8216;this is nonsense&#8217;.</p>

<p>Although a philosopher cannot, by culture, make
himself, in the peculiar sense in which we now use
the term, a poet, unless at least he have that peculiarity
of nature which would probably have made
poetry his earliest pursuit; a poet may always, by
culture, make himself a philosopher. The poetic
laws of association are by no means incompatible
with the more ordinary laws; are by no means such
as <i>must</i> have their course, even though a deliberate
purpose require their suspension. If the peculiarities
of the poetic temperament were uncontrollable
in any poet, they might be supposed so in
Shelley; yet how powerfully, in the <i>Cenci</i>, does he
coerce and restrain all the characteristic qualities
of his genius; what severe simplicity, in place of
his usual barbaric splendour; how rigidly does he
keep the feelings and the imagery in subordination
to the thought.</p>

<p>The investigation of nature requires no habits or
qualities of mind, but such as may always be
acquired by industry and mental activity. Because
at one time the mind may be so given up to a state
of feeling, that the succession of its ideas is determined
by the present enjoyment or suffering which
pervades it, this is no reason but that in the calm
retirement of study, when under no peculiar excitement
either of the outward or of the inward
sense, it may form any combinations, or pursue any
trains of ideas, which are most conducive to the
purposes of philosophic inquiry; and may, while
in that state, form deliberate convictions, from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
which no excitement will afterwards make it
swerve. Might we not go even further than this?
We shall not pause to ask whether it be not a misunderstanding
of the nature of passionate feeling to
imagine that it is inconsistent with calmness;
whether they who so deem of it, do not mistake
passion in the militant or antagonistic state, for
the type of passion universally; do not confound
passion struggling towards an outward object, with
passion brooding over itself. But without entering
into this deeper investigation; that capacity of
strong feeling, which is supposed necessarily to disturb
the judgement, is also the material out of
which all <i>motives</i> are made; the motives, consequently,
which lead human beings to the pursuit of
truth. The greater the individual&#8217;s capability of
happiness and of misery, the stronger interest has
that individual in arriving at truth; and when once
that interest is felt, an impassioned nature is sure
to pursue this, as to pursue any other object, with
greater ardour; for energy of character is commonly
the offspring of strong feeling. If, therefore,
the most impassioned natures do not ripen into the
most powerful intellects, it is always from defect of
culture, or something wrong in the circumstances by
which the being has originally or successively been
surrounded. Undoubtedly strong feelings require
a strong intellect to carry them, as more sail requires
more ballast: and when, from neglect, or
bad education, that strength is wanting, no wonder
if the grandest and swiftest vessels make the most
utter wreck.</p>

<p>Where, as in some of our older poets, a poetic
nature has been united with logical and scientific
culture, the peculiarity of association arising from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
the finer nature so perpetually alternates with
the associations attainable by commoner natures
trained to high perfection, that its own particular
law is not so conspicuously characteristic of the
result produced, as in a poet like Shelley, to whom
systematic intellectual culture, in a measure proportioned
to the intensity of his own nature,
has been wanting. Whether the superiority will
naturally be on the side of the philosopher-poet or
of the mere poet&mdash;whether the writings of the one
ought, as a whole, to be truer, and their influence
more beneficent, than those of the other&mdash;is
too obvious in principle to need statement: it
would be absurd to doubt whether two endowments
are better than one; whether truth is more certainly
arrived at by two processes, verifying and
correcting each other, than by one alone. Unfortunately,
in practice the matter is not quite so
simple; there the question often is, which is least
prejudicial to the intellect, uncultivation or malcultivation.
For, as long as education consists
chiefly of the mere inculcation of traditional
opinions, many of which, from the mere fact that
the human intellect has not yet reached perfection,
must necessarily be false; so long as even those
who are best taught, are rather taught to know the
thoughts of others than to think, it is not always
clear that the poet of acquired ideas has the advantage
over him whose feeling has been his sole
teacher. For the depth and durability of wrong
as well as of right impressions is proportional to
the fineness of the material; and they who have
the greatest capacity of natural feeling are generally
those whose artificial feelings are the strongest.
Hence, doubtless, among other reasons, it is, that in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
an age of revolutions in opinion, the co-temporary
poets, those at least who deserve the name, those
who have any individuality of character, if they are
not before their age, are almost sure to be behind it.
An observation curiously verified all over Europe
in the present century. Nor let it be thought disparaging.
However urgent may be the necessity
for a breaking up of old modes of belief, the most
strong-minded and discerning, next to those who
head the movement, are generally those who bring
up the rear of it.</p>

language which is the natural expression of feeling, is really
poetical, and will be felt as such, apart from conventional
associations; but on the other, whenever intellectual
culture has afforded a choice between several modes of
expressing the same emotion, the stronger the feeling is,
the more naturally and certainly will it prefer the language
which is most peculiarly appropriated to itself, and kept
sacred from the contact of more vulgar objects of contemplation.</p></div>

very characteristic of modern art, and we want to
show how they are characteristic.</p>

<p>Neither English poetry nor English criticism
have ever recovered the <i>eruption</i> which they both
made at the beginning of this century into the
fashionable world. The poems of Lord Byron
were received with an avidity that resembles our
present avidity for sensation novels, and were
read by a class which at present reads little but
such novels. Old men who remember those days
may be heard to say, &#8216;We hear nothing of poetry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
nowadays; it seems quite down.&#8217; And &#8216;down&#8217;
it certainly is, if for poetry it be a descent to be
no longer the favourite excitement of the more
frivolous part of the &#8216;upper&#8217; world. That
stimulating poetry is now little read. A stray
schoolboy may still be detected in a wild admiration
for the <i>Giaour</i> or the <i>Corsair</i> (and it is suitable
to his age, and he should not be reproached for it),
but the <i>real</i> posterity&mdash;the quiet students of a past
literature&mdash;never read them or think of them.
A line or two linger in the memory; a few telling
strokes of occasional and felicitous energy are
quoted, but this is all. As wholes, these exaggerated
stories were worthless; they taught nothing,
and, therefore, they are forgotten. If nowadays
a dismal poet were, like Byron, to lament the
fact of his birth, and to hint that he was too good
for the world, the <i>Saturday Review</i> would say that
&#8216;they doubted if he <i>was</i> too good; that a sulky
poet was a questionable addition to a tolerable
world; that he need not have been born, as far
as they were concerned.&#8217; Doubtless, there is
much in Byron besides his dismal exaggeration,
but it was that exaggeration which made &#8216;the
sensation&#8217;, which gave him a wild moment of
dangerous fame. As so often happens, the cause
of his momentary fashion is the cause also of his
lasting oblivion. Moore&#8217;s former reputation was
less excessive, yet it has not been more permanent.
The prettiness of a few songs preserves the memory
of his name, but as a poet to <i>read</i> he is forgotten.
There is nothing to read in him; no exquisite
thought, no sublime feeling, no consummate
description of true character. Almost the sole
result of the poetry of that time is the harm which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
it has done. It degraded for a time the whole
character of the art. It said by practice, by
a most efficient and successful practice, that it
was the aim, the <i>duty</i> of poets, to catch the
attention of the passing, the fashionable, the busy
world. If a poem &#8216;fell dead&#8217;, it was nothing; it
was composed to please the &#8216;London&#8217; of the year,
and if that London did not like it, why, it had
failed. It fixed upon the minds of a whole
generation, it engraved in popular memory and
tradition, a vague conviction that poetry is but
one of the many <i>amusements</i> for the light classes,
for the lighter hours of all classes. The mere
notion, the bare idea, that poetry is a deep thing,
a teaching thing, the most surely and wisely
elevating of human things, is even now to the
coarse public mind nearly unknown.</p>

<p>As was the fate of poetry, so inevitably was that
of criticism. The science that expounds which
poetry is good and which is bad is dependent for
its popular reputation on the popular estimate of
poetry itself. The critics of that day had <i>a</i> day,
which is more than can be said for some since;
they professed to tell the fashionable world in
what books it would find new pleasure, and
therefore they were read by the fashionable world.
Byron counted the critic and poet equal. The
<i>Edinburgh Review</i> penetrated among the young,
and into places of female resort where it does not
go now. As people ask, &#8216;Have you read <i>Henry
Dunbar</i>? and what do you think of it?&#8217; so they
then asked, &#8216;Have you read the <i>Giaour</i>? and
what do you think of it?&#8217; Lord Jeffrey, a shrewd
judge of the world, employed himself in telling it
what to think; not so much what it ought to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
think, as what at bottom it did think, and so by
dexterous sympathy with current society he gained
contemporary fame and power. Such fame no
critic must hope for now. His articles will not
penetrate where the poems themselves do not
penetrate. When poetry was noisy, criticism was
loud; now poetry is a still small voice, and
criticism must be smaller and stiller. As the
function of such criticism was limited so was its
subject. For the great and (as time now proves)
the <i>permanent</i> part of the poetry of his time&mdash;for
Shelley and for Wordsworth&mdash;Lord Jeffrey had
but one word. He said<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> &#8216;It won&#8217;t do&#8217;. And it
will not do to amuse a drawing-room.</p>

<p>The doctrine that poetry is a light amusement
for idle hours, a metrical species of sensational
novel, has not indeed been without gainsayers
wildly popular. Thirty years ago, Mr. Carlyle
most rudely contradicted it. But perhaps this is
about all that he has done. He has denied, but
he has not disproved. He has contradicted the
floating paganism, but he has not founded the
deep religion. All about and around us a <i>faith</i> in
poetry struggles to be extricated, but it is not
extricated. Some day, at the touch of the true
word, the whole confusion will by magic cease;
the broken and shapeless notions cohere and
crystallize into a bright and true theory. But
this cannot be yet.</p>

<p>But though no complete theory of the poetic
art as yet be possible for us, though perhaps only
our children&#8217;s children will be able to speak on
this subject with the assured confidence which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>belongs to accepted truth, yet something of some
certainty may be stated on the easier elements,
and something that will throw light on these two
new books. But it will be necessary to assign
reasons, and the assigning of reasons is a dry task.
Years ago, when criticism only tried to show how
poetry could be made a good amusement, it was
not impossible that criticism itself should be
amusing. But now it must at least be serious, for
we believe that poetry is a serious and a deep
thing.</p>

<p>There should be a word in the language of literary
art to express what the word &#8216;picturesque&#8217; expresses
for the fine arts. <i>Picturesque</i> means fit to
be put into a picture; we want a word <i>literatesque</i>,
&#8216;fit to be put into a book.&#8217; An artist goes through
a hundred different country scenes, rich with
beauties, charms, and merits, but he does not
paint any of them. He leaves them alone; he
idles on till he finds the hundred-and-first&mdash;a scene
which many observers would not think much of,
but which <i>he</i> knows by virtue of his art will look
well on canvas, and this he paints and preserves.
Susceptible observers, though not artists, feel this
quality too; they say of a scene, &#8216;How picturesque!&#8217;
meaning by this a quality distinct from
that of beauty, or sublimity, or grandeur&mdash;meaning
to speak not only of the scene as it is in itself, but
also of its fitness for imitation by art; meaning
not only that it is good, but that its goodness is
such as ought to be transferred to paper; meaning
not simply that it fascinates, but also that its
fascination is such as ought to be copied by man.
A fine and insensible instinct has put language to
this subtle use; it expresses an idea without which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
fine art criticism could not go on, and it is very
natural that the language of pictorial should be
better supplied with words than that of literary
criticism, for the eye was used before the mind,
and language embodies primitive sensuous ideas,
long ere it expresses, or need express, abstract and
literary ones.</p>

<p>The reason why a landscape is &#8216;picturesque&#8217; is
often said to be that such landscape represents an
&#8216;idea&#8217;. But this explanation, though in the minds
of some who use it it is near akin to the truth, fails
to explain that truth to those who did not know it
before; the Word &#8216;idea,&#8217; is so often used in these
subjects when people do not know anything else
to say; it represents so often a kind of intellectual
insolvency, when philosophers are at their wits&#8217;
end, that shrewd people will never readily on any
occasion give it credit for meaning anything.
A wise explainer must, therefore, look out for
other words to convey what he has to say.
<i>Landscapes</i>, like everything else in nature, divide
themselves as we look at them into a sort of rude
classification. We go down a river, for example,
and we see a hundred landscapes on both sides of
it, resembling one another in much, yet differing
in something; with trees here, and a farmhouse
there, and shadows on one side, and a deep pool
far on; a collection of circumstances most familiar
in themselves, but making a perpetual novelty by
the magic of their various combinations. We travel
so for miles and hours, and then we come to a
scene which also has these various circumstances
and adjuncts, but which combines them best,
which makes the best whole of them, which shows
them in their best proportion at a single glance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
before the eye. Then we say, &#8216;This is the place
to paint the river; this is the picturesque point!&#8217;
Or, if not artists or critics of art, we feel without
analysis or examination that somehow this bend or
sweep of the river, shall, in future, <i>be the river to us</i>:
that it is the image of it which we will retain in
our mind&#8217;s eye, by which we will remember it,
which we will call up when we want to describe or
think of it. Some fine countries, some beautiful
rivers, have not this picturesque quality: they
give us elements of beauty, but they do not combine
them together; we go on for a time delighted,
but <i>after</i> a time somehow we get wearied; we feel
that we are taking in nothing and learning nothing;
we get no collected image before our mind; we see
the accidents and circumstances of that sort of
scenery, but the summary scene we do not see;
we find <i>disjecta membra</i>, but no form; various and
many and faulty approximations are displayed
in succession; but the absolute perfection in that
country or river&#8217;s scenery&mdash;its <i>type</i>&mdash;is withheld:
We go away from such places in part delighted,
but in part baffled; we have been puzzled by
pretty things; we have beheld a hundred different
inconsistent specimens of the same sort of beauty;
but the rememberable idea, the full development,
the characteristic individuality of it, we have not
seen.</p>

<p>We find the same sort of quality in all parts of
painting. We see a portrait of a person we know,
and we say, &#8216;It is like&mdash;yes, like, of course, but
it is not <i>the man</i>;&#8217; we feel it could not be any one
else, but still, somehow it fails to bring home to
us the individual as we know him to be. <i>He</i> is not
there. An accumulation of features like his are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
painted, but his essence is not painted; an
approximation more or less excellent is given, but
the characteristic expression, the <i>typical</i> form, of
the man is withheld.</p>

<p>Literature&mdash;the painting of words&mdash;has the same
quality but wants the analogous word. The word
&#8216;<i>literatesque</i>,&#8217; would mean, if we possessed it, that
perfect combination in the <i>subject-matter</i> of literature,
which suits the <i>art</i> of literature. We often
meet people, and say of them, sometimes meaning
well and sometimes ill, &#8216;How well so-and-so
would do in a book!&#8217; Such people are by no
means the best people; but they are the most
effective people&mdash;the most rememberable people.
Frequently when we first know them, we like
them because they explain to us so much of our
experience; we have known many people &#8216;like
that,&#8217; in one way or another, but we did not seem
to understand them; they were nothing to us,
for their traits were indistinct; we forgot them,
for they <i>hitched</i> on to nothing, and we could not
classify them; but when we see the <i>type</i> of the
genus, at once we seem to comprehend its character;
the inferior specimens are explained by the perfect
embodiment; the approximations are definable
when we know the ideal to which they draw near.
There are an infinite number of classes of human
beings, but in each of these classes there is a distinctive
type which, if we could expand it out in words,
would define the class. We cannot expand it in
formal terms any more than a landscape or
a species of landscapes; but we have an art, an
art of words, which can draw it. Travellers and
others often bring home, in addition to their long
journals&mdash;which though so living to them, are so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
dead, so inanimate, so undescriptive to all else&mdash;a
pen-and-ink sketch, rudely done very likely, but
which, perhaps, even the more for the blots and
strokes, gives a distinct notion, an emphatic
image, to all who see it. They say at once, &#8216;<i>Now</i>
we know the sort of thing&#8217;. The sketch has <i>hit</i> the
mind. True literature does the same. It describes
sorts, varieties, and permutations, by delineating
the type of each sort, the ideal of each variety, the
central, the marking trait of each permutation.</p>

<p>On this account, the greatest artists of the
world have ever shown an enthusiasm for reality.
To care for notions and abstractions; to philosophize;
to reason out conclusions; to care for
schemes of thought, are signs in the artistic mind
of secondary excellence. A Schiller, a Euripides,
a Ben Jonson, cares for <i>ideas</i>&mdash;for the parings of
the intellect, and the distillation of the mind;
a Shakespeare, a Homer, a Goethe, finds his
mental occupation, the true home of his natural
thoughts, in the real world&mdash;&#8216;which is the world
of all of us&#8217;&mdash;where the face of nature, the moving
masses of men and women, are ever changing, ever
multiplying, ever mixing one with the other. The
reason is plain&mdash;the business of the poet, of the
artist, is with <i>types</i>; and those types are mirrored
in reality. As a painter must not only have a
hand to execute, but an eye to distinguish&mdash;as he
must go here and then there through the real world
to catch the picturesque man, the picturesque
scene, which is to live on his canvas&mdash;so the poet
must find in that reality, the <i>literatesque</i> man, the
<i>literatesque</i> scene which nature intends for him,
and which will live in his page. Even in reality he
will not find this type complete, or the characteristics<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
perfect; but there, at least, he will find
<i>something</i>, some hint, some intimation, some
suggestion; whereas, in the stagnant home of his
own thoughts he will find nothing pure, nothing <i>as it
is</i>, nothing which does not bear his own mark, which
is not somehow altered by a mixture with himself.</p>

<p>The first conversation of Goethe and Schiller
illustrates this conception of the poet&#8217;s art.
Goethe was at that time prejudiced against
Schiller, we must remember, partly from what
he considered the <i>outrages</i> of the <i>Robbers</i>, partly
because of the philosophy of Kant. Schiller&#8217;s
&#8216;Essay on <i>Grace and Dignity</i>&#8217;, he tells us, &#8216;was
yet less of a kind to reconcile me. The philosophy
of Kant, which exalts the dignity of mind so
highly, while appearing to restrict it, Schiller had
joyfully embraced: it unfolded the extraordinary
qualities which Nature had implanted in him;
and in the lively feeling of freedom and self-direction,
he showed himself unthankful to the
Great Mother, who surely had not acted like
a step-dame towards him. Instead of viewing her
as self-subsisting, as producing with a living force,
and according to appointed laws, alike the highest
and the lowest of her works, he took her up under
the aspect of some empirical native qualities of
the human mind. Certain harsh passages I could
even directly apply to myself: they exhibited
my confession of faith in a false light; and I felt
that if written without particular attention to me
they were still worse; for in that case, the vast
chasm which lay between us, gaped but so much
the more distinctly.&#8217; After a casual meeting at
a Society for Natural History, they walked home
and Goethe proceeds:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8216;We reached his house; the talk induced me
to go in. I then expounded to him, with as much
vivacity as possible, the <i>Metamorphosis of Plants</i>,
drawing out on paper, with many characteristic
strokes, a symbolic Plant for him, as I proceeded.
He heard and saw all this, with much interest and
distinct comprehension; but when I had done,
he shook his head and said: &#8216;This is no experiment,
this is an idea.&#8217; I stopped with some degree of
irritation; for the point which separated us was
most luminously marked by this expression. The
opinions in <i>Dignity and Grace</i>, again occurred to
me; the old grudge was just awakening; but
I smothered it, and merely said: &#8220;I was happy to
find that I had got ideas without knowing it, nay
that I saw them before my eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8216;Schiller had much more prudence and dexterity
of management than I; he was also thinking of
his periodical the <i>Horen</i>, about this time, and of
course rather wished to attract than repel me.
Accordingly he answered me like an accomplished
Kantite; and as my stiff-necked Realism gave
occasion to many contradictions, much battling
took place between us, and at last a truce, in
which neither party would consent to yield the
victory, but each held himself invincible. Positions
like the following grieved me to the very soul:
<i>How can there ever be an experiment, that shall
correspond with an idea? The specific quality of
an idea is, that no experiment can reach it or agree
with it.</i> Yet if he held as an idea, the same thing
which I looked upon as an experiment; there must
certainly, I thought, be some community between
us, some ground whereon both of us might meet!&#8217;</p>

<p>With Goethe&#8217;s natural history, or with Kant&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
philosophy, we have here no concern, but we can
combine the expressions of the two great poets
into a nearly complete description of poetry.
The &#8216;symbolic plant&#8217; is the <i>type</i> of which we
speak, the ideal at which inferior specimens aim,
the class-characteristic in which they all share,
but which none shows forth fully: Goethe was
right in searching for this in reality and nature;
Schiller was right in saying that it was an &#8216;idea&#8217;,
a transcending notion to which approximations
could be found in experience, but only approximations&mdash;which
could not be found there itself.
Goethe, as a poet, rightly felt the primary necessity
of outward suggestion and experience; Schiller as
a philosopher, rightly felt its imperfection.</p>

<p>But in these delicate matters, it is easy to
misapprehend. There is, undoubtedly, a sort of
poetry which is produced as it were out of the
author&#8217;s mind. The description of the poet&#8217;s own
moods and feelings is a common sort of poetry&mdash;perhaps
the commonest sort. But the peculiarity
of such cases is, that the poet does not describe
himself <i>as</i> himself: autobiography is not his object;
he takes himself as a specimen of human nature; he
describes, not himself, but a distillation of himself:
he takes such of his moods as are most characteristic,
as most typify certain moods of certain men, or
certain moods of all men; he chooses preponderant
feelings of special sorts of men, or occasional
feelings of men of all sorts; but with whatever
other difference and diversity, the essence is that
such self-describing poets describe what is <i>in</i>
them, but not <i>peculiar</i> to them,&mdash;what is generic,
not what is special and individual. Gray&#8217;s <i>Elegy</i>
describes a mood which Gray felt more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
other men, but which most others, perhaps all
others, feel too. It is more popular, perhaps, than
any English poem, because that sort of feeling is
the most diffused of high feelings, and because
Gray added to a singular nicety of fancy an
habitual proneness to a <i>contemplative</i>&mdash;a discerning
but unbiassed&mdash;meditation on death and on life.
Other poets cannot hope for such success: a subject,
so popular, so grave, so wise, and yet so suitable
to the writer&#8217;s nature is hardly to be found.
But the same ideal, the same unautobiographical
character is to be found in the writings of meaner
men. Take sonnets of Hartley Coleridge, for
example:</p>

<p>The contrast of instructive and enviable locomotion
with refining but instructive meditation
is not special and peculiar to these two, but general
and universal. It was set down by Hartley
Coleridge because he was the most meditative and
refining of men.</p>

<p>What sort of literatesque types are fit to be
described in the sort of literature called poetry, is
a matter on which much might be written.
Mr. Arnold, some years since, put forth a theory
that the art of poetry could only delineate <i>great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
actions</i>. But though, rightly interpreted and
understood&mdash;using the word action so as to include
high and sound activity in contemplation&mdash;this
definition may suit the highest poetry, it certainly
cannot be stretched to include many inferior sorts
and even many good sorts. Nobody in their
senses would describe Gray&#8217;s <i>Elegy</i> as the
delineation of a &#8216;great action&#8217;; some kinds of
mental contemplation may be energetic enough
to deserve this name, but Gray would have been
frightened at the very word. He loved scholar-like
calm and quiet inaction; his very greatness
depended on his <i>not</i> acting, on his &#8216;wise passiveness,&#8217;
on his indulging the grave idleness which so well
appreciates so much of human life. But the best
answer&mdash;the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>&mdash;of Mr. Arnold&#8217;s
doctrine, is the mutilation which it has caused
him to make of his own writings. It has forbidden

<p>What freak of criticism can induce a man who
has written such poetry as this, to discard it, and
say it is not poetry? Mr. Arnold is privileged to
speak of his own poems, but no other critic could
speak so and not be laughed at.</p>

<p>We are disposed to believe that no very sharp
definition can be given&mdash;at least in the present
state of the critical art&mdash;of the boundary line
between poetry and other sorts of imaginative
delineation. Between the undoubted dominions
of the two kinds there is a debateable land;
everybody is agreed that the <i>Oedipus at Colonus</i>
<i>is</i> poetry: every one is agreed that the wonderful
appearance of Mrs. Veal is <i>not</i> poetry. But the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
exact line which separates grave novels in verse
like <i>Aylmer&#8217;s Field</i> or <i>Enoch Arden</i>, from grave
novels not in verse like <i>Silas Marner</i> or <i>Adam
Bede</i>, we own we cannot draw with any confidence.
Nor, perhaps, is it very important; whether a
narrative is thrown into verse or not certainly
depends in part on the taste of the age, and in part
on its mechanical helps. Verse is the only
mechanical help to the memory in rude times, and
there is little writing till a cheap something is
found to write upon, and a cheap something to
write with. Poetry&mdash;verse at least&mdash;is the
literature of <i>all work</i> in early ages; it is only
later ages which write in what <i>they</i> think a natural
and simple prose. There are other casual influences
in the matter too; but they are not material now.
We need only say here that poetry, because it has
a more marked rhythm than prose, must be more
intense in meaning and more concise in style than
prose. People expect a &#8216;marked rhythm&#8217; to
imply something worth marking; if it fails to do
so they are disappointed. They are displeased at
the visible waste of a powerful instrument; they
call it &#8216;doggerel,&#8217; and rightly call it, for the
metrical expression of full thought and eager
feeling&mdash;the burst of metre&mdash;incident to high
imagination, should not be wasted on petty
matters which prose does as well,&mdash;which it does
better&mdash;which it suits by its very limpness and
weakness, whose small changes it follows more
easily, and to whose lowest details it can fully
and without effort degrade itself. Verse, too,
should be <i>more concise</i>, for long-continued rhythm
tends to jade the mind, just as brief rhythm
tends to attract the attention. Poetry should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
be memorable and emphatic, intense, and <i>soon
over</i>.</p>

<p>The great divisions of poetry, and of all other
literary art, arise from the different modes in
which these <i>types</i>&mdash;these characteristic men, these
characteristic feelings&mdash;may be variously described.
There are three principal modes which we shall
attempt to describe&mdash;the <i>pure</i>, which is sometimes,
but not very wisely, called the classical; the <i>ornate</i>,
which is also unwisely called romantic; and the
<i>grotesque</i>, which might be called the mediaeval.
We will describe the nature of these a little.
Criticism we know must be brief&mdash;not, like poetry,
because its charm is too intense to be sustained&mdash;but
on the contrary, because its interest is too weak
to be prolonged; but elementary criticism, if an
evil, is a necessary evil; a little while spent among
the simple principles of art is the first condition,
the absolute pre-requisite, for surely apprehending
and wisely judging the complete embodiments and
miscellaneous forms of actual literature.</p>

<p>The definition of <i>pure</i> literature is that it
describes the type in its simplicity, we mean, with
the exact amount of accessory circumstance which
is necessary to bring it before the mind in finished
perfection, and <i>no more</i> than that amount. The
<i>type</i> needs some accessories from its nature&mdash;a
picturesque landscape does not consist wholly
of picturesque features. There is a setting of
surroundings&mdash;as the Americans would say, of
<i>fixings</i>&mdash;without which the reality is not itself.
By a traditional mode of speech, as soon as we
see a picture in which a complete effect is produced
by detail so rare and so harmonized as to escape
us, we say &#8216;how classical&#8217;. The whole which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
to be seen appears at once and through the detail,
but the detail itself is not seen: we do not think
of that which gives us the idea; we are absorbed
in the idea itself. Just so in literature the pure
art is that which works with the fewest strokes;
the fewest, that is, for its purpose, for its aim
is to call up and bring home to men an idea, a
form, a character, and if that idea be twisted, that
form be involved, that character perplexed, many
strokes of literary art will be needful. Pure art
does not mutilate its object: it represents it as
fully as is possible with the slightest effort which
is possible: it shrinks from no needful circumstances,
as little as it inserts any which are
needless. The precise peculiarity is not merely
that no incidental circumstance is inserted which
does not tell on the main design: no art is fit to
be called <i>art</i> which permits a stroke to be put in
without an object; but that only the minimum
of such circumstance is inserted at all. The form
is sometimes said to be bare, the accessories are
sometimes said to be invisible, because the
appendages are so choice that the shape only is
perceived.</p>

<p>The English literature undoubtedly contains
much impure literature; impure in its style if
not in its meaning: but it also contains one
great, one nearly perfect, model of the pure style
in the literary expression of typical <i>sentiment</i>;
and one not perfect, but gigantic and close
approximation to perfection in the pure delineation
of objective character. Wordsworth, perhaps,
comes as near to choice purity of style in sentiment
as is possible; Milton, with exceptions and
conditions to be explained, approaches perfection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
by the strenuous purity with which he depicts
character.</p>

<p>A wit once said, that &#8216;<i>pretty</i> women had more
features than <i>beautiful</i> women&#8217;, and though the
expression may be criticized, the meaning is correct.
Pretty women seem to have a great number of
attractive points, each of which attracts your
attention, and each one of which you remember
afterwards; yet these points have not <i>grown
together</i>, their features have not linked themselves
into a single inseparable whole. But a beautiful
woman is a whole as she is; you no more take
her to pieces than a Greek statue; she is not an
aggregate of divisible charms, she is a charm in
herself. Such ever is the dividing test of pure art;
if you catch yourself admiring its details, it is
defective; you ought to think of it as a single
whole which you must remember, which you
must admire, which somehow subdues you while
you admire it, which is a &#8216;possession&#8217; to you &#8216;for
ever&#8217;.</p>

<p>Of course no individual poem embodies this
ideal perfectly; of course every human word
and phrase has its imperfections, and if we choose
an instance to illustrate that ideal, the instance
has scarcely a fair chance. By contrasting it
with the ideal we suggest its imperfections; by
protruding it as an example, we turn on its
defectiveness the microscope of criticism. Yet
these two sonnets of Wordsworth may be fitly
read in this place, not because they are quite
without faults, or because they are the very best
examples of their kind of style; but because they
are <i>luminous</i> examples; the compactness of the
sonnet and the gravity of the sentiment, hedging in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
the thoughts, restraining the fancy, and helping to
maintain a singleness of expression:</p>

<p>Instances of barer style than this may easily

If, indeed, we take out the phrase&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The city now doth like a garment wear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beauty of the morning,<br /></span>

<p class="noin">they have independent value, but they are not
noticed in the sonnet when we read it through;
they fall into place there, and being in their place
are not seen. The great subjects of the two
sonnets, the religious aspect of beautiful but
grave nature&mdash;the religious aspect of a city about
to awaken and be alive, are the only ideas left in
our mind. To Wordsworth has been vouchsafed
the last grace of the self-denying artist; you
think neither of him nor his style, but you cannot
help thinking of&mdash;you <i>must</i> recall&mdash;the exact
phrase, the <i>very</i> sentiment he wished.</p>

<p>Milton&#8217;s purity is more eager. In the most
exciting parts of Wordsworth&mdash;and these sonnets
are not very exciting&mdash;you always feel, you never
forget, that what you have before you is the
excitement of a recluse. There is nothing of the
stir of life; nothing of the <i>brawl</i> of the world.
But Milton though always a scholar by trade,
though solitary in old age, was through life intent
on great affairs, lived close to great scenes, watched
a revolution, and if not an actor in it, was at least
secretary to the actors. He was familiar&mdash;by
daily experience and habitual sympathy&mdash;with
the earnest debate of arduous questions, on which
the life and death of the speakers certainly
depended, on which the weal or woe of the country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
perhaps depended. He knew how profoundly the
individual character of the speakers&mdash;their inner
and real nature&mdash;modifies their opinion on such
questions; he knew how surely that nature will
appear in the expression of them. This great
experience, fashioned by a fine imagination, gives
to the debate of Satanic Council in Pandaemonium
its reality and its life. It is a debate in the Long
Parliament, and though the <i>theme</i> of <i>Paradise
Lost</i> obliged Milton to side with the monarchical
element in the universe, his old habits are often
too much for him; and his real sympathy&mdash;the
impetus and energy of his nature&mdash;side with the
rebellious element. For the purposes of art this
is much better&mdash;of a court, a poet can make but
little; of a heaven he can make very little, but
of a courtly heaven, such as Milton conceived, he
can make nothing at all. The idea of a court and
the idea of a heaven are so radically different,
that a distinct combination of them is always
grotesque and often ludicrous. <i>Paradise Lost</i>, as
a whole, is radically tainted by a vicious principle.
It professes to justify the ways of God to man, to
account for sin and death, and it tells you that the
whole originated in a political event; in a court
squabble as to a particular act of patronage and
the due or undue promotion of an eldest son. Satan
may have been wrong, but on Milton&#8217;s theory he
had an <i>arguable</i> case at least. There was something
arbitrary in the promotion; there were little
symptoms of a job; in <i>Paradise Lost</i> it is always
clear that the devils are the weaker, but it is never
clear that the angels are the better. Milton&#8217;s
sympathy and his imagination slip back to the
Puritan rebels whom he loved, and desert the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
courtly angels whom he could not love although he
praised. There is no wonder that Milton&#8217;s hell is
better than his heaven, for he hated officials and
he loved rebels, for he employs his genius below,
and accumulates his pedantry above. On the
great debate in Pandaemonium all his genius is
concentrated. The question is very practical; it
is, &#8216;What are we devils to do, now we have lost
heaven?&#8217; Satan who presides over and manipulates
the assembly; Moloch</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i11">the fiercest spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fought in Heaven, now fiercer by despair,<br /></span>

<p class="noin">who, at Satan&#8217;s instance, proposes the invasion of
earth&mdash;are as distinct as so many statues. Even
Belial, &#8216;the man of the world&#8217;, the sort of man with
whom Milton had least sympathy, is perfectly
painted. An inferior artist would have made the
actor who &#8216;counselled ignoble ease and peaceful
sloth&#8217;, a degraded and ugly creature; but Milton
knew better. He knew that low notions require
a better garb than high notions. Human nature is
not a high thing, but at least it has a high idea of
itself; it will not accept mean maxims, unless they
are gilded and made beautiful. A prophet in
goatskin may cry, &#8216;Repent, repent&#8217;, but it takes
&#8216;purple and fine linen&#8217; to be able to say, &#8216;Continue
in your sins&#8217;. The world vanquishes with its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
speciousness and its show, and the orator who is
to persuade men to worldliness must have a share
in them. Milton well knew this; after the warlike
speech of the fierce Moloch he introduces a brighter
and a more graceful spirit:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He ended frowning, and his look denounced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Desp&#8217;rate revenge, and battle dangerous<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To less than Gods. On th&#8217; other side up rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Belial, in act more graceful and humane:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fairer person lost not Heaven; he seem&#8217;d<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For dignity composed and high exploit:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all was false and hollow, though his tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dropt manna, and could make the worse appear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The better reason, to perplex and dash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maturest counsels: for his thoughts were low;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To vice industrious, but to nobler deeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tim&#8217;rous and slothful: yet he pleased the ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with persuasive accent thus began:<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He does not begin like a man with a strong case,
but like a man with a weak case; he knows that
the pride of human nature is irritated by mean
advice, and though he may probably persuade men
to <i>take</i> it, he must carefully apologise for <i>giving</i> it.
Here, as elsewhere, though the formal address is
to devils, the real address is to men: to the human
nature which we know, not to the fictitious demonic
nature we do not know:</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt knew this speech by heart, and Lord
Macaulay has called it incomparable; and these
judges of the oratorical art have well decided.
A mean foreign policy cannot be better defended.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
Its sensibleness is effectually explained, and its
tameness as much as possible disguised.</p>

<p>But we have not here to do with the excellence
of Belial&#8217;s policy, but with the excellence of his
speech; and with that speech in a peculiar manner.
This speech, taken with the few lines of description
with which Milton introduces them, embody, in
as short a space as possible, with as much perfection
as possible, the delineation of the type of character
common at all times, dangerous in many times,
sure to come to the surface in moments of difficulty,
and never more dangerous than then. As Milton
describes, it is one among several <i>typical</i> characters
which will ever have their place in great councils,
which will ever be heard at important decisions,
which are part of the characteristic and inalienable
whole of this statesmanlike world. The debate in
Pandaemonium is a debate among these typical
characters at the greatest conceivable crisis, and
with adjuncts of solemnity which no other situation
could rival. It is the greatest <i>classical</i> triumph,
the highest achievement of the pure <i>style</i> in
English literature; it is the greatest description
of the highest and most typical characters with
the most choice circumstances and in the fewest
words.</p>

<p>It is not unremarkable that we should find in
Milton and in <i>Paradise Lost</i> the best specimen of
pure style. He was schoolmaster in a pedantic age,
and there is nothing so unclassical&mdash;nothing so
impure in style&mdash;as pedantry. The out-of-door
conversational life of Athens was as opposed to
bookish scholasticism as a life can be. The most
perfect books have been written not by those who
thought much of books, but by those who thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
little, by those who were under the restraint of
a sensitive talking world, to which books had
contributed something, and a various eager life
the rest. Milton is generally unclassical in spirit
where he is learned, and naturally, because the
purest poets do not overlay their conceptions
with book knowledge, and the classical poets,
having in comparison no books, were under little
temptation to impair the purity of their style by
the accumulation of their research. Over and
above this, there is in Milton, and a little in
Wordsworth also, one defect which is in the
highest degree faulty and unclassical, which mars
the effect and impairs the perfection of the pure
style. There is a want of <i>spontaneity</i>, and a sense
of effort. It has been happily said that Plato&#8217;s
words must have <i>grown</i> into their places. No one
would say so of Milton or even of Wordsworth.
About both of them there is a taint of duty;
a vicious sense of the good man&#8217;s task. Things
seem right where they are, but they seem to be
put where they are. <i>Flexibility</i> is essential to the
consummate perfection of the pure style because
the sensation of the poet&#8217;s efforts carries away
our thoughts from his achievements. We are
admiring his labours when we should be enjoying
his words. But this is a defect in those two writers,
not a defect in pure art. Of course it is more
difficult to write in few words than to write in
many; to take the best adjuncts, and those only,
for what you have to say, instead of using all
which comes to hand; it <i>is</i> an additional labour if
you write verses in a morning, to spend the rest of
the day in <i>choosing</i>, or making those verses fewer.
But a perfect artist in the pure style is as effortless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
and as natural as in any style, perhaps is more so.
Take the well-known lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was a little lawny islet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By anemone and violet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like mosaic, paven:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And its roof was flowers and leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which the summer&#8217;s breath enweaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where nor sun, nor showers, nor breeze,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Each a gem engraven;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Girt by many an azure wave<br /></span>

<span class="i2">A lake&#8217;s blue chasm.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Shelley had many merits and many defects.
This is not the place for a complete or indeed for
<i>any</i> estimate of him. But one excellence is most
evident. His words are as flexible as any words;
the rhythm of some modulating air seems to move
them into their place without a struggle by the
poet and almost without his knowledge. This is
the perfection of pure art, to embody typical
conceptions in the choicest, the fewest accidents,
to embody them so that each of these accidents
may produce its full effect, and so to embody
them without effort.</p>

<p>The extreme opposite to this pure art is what
may be called ornate art. This species of art
aims also at giving a delineation of the typical
idea in its perfection and its fullness, but it aims
at so doing in a manner most different. It wishes
to surround the type with the greatest number of
circumstances which it will <i>bear</i>. It works not by
choice and selection, but by accumulation and
aggregation. The idea is not, as in the pure style,
presented with the least clothing which it will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
endure, but with the richest and most involved
clothing that it will admit.</p>

<p>We are fortunate in not having to hunt out of
past literature an illustrative specimen of the
ornate style. Mr. Tennyson has just given one
admirable in itself, and most characteristic of the
defects and the merits of this style. The story of
Enoch Arden, as he has enhanced and presented
it, is a rich and splendid composite of imagery
and illustration. Yet how simple that story is in
itself. A sailor who sells fish, breaks his leg, gets
dismal, gives up selling fish, goes to sea, is wrecked
on a desert island, stays there some years, on his
return finds his wife married to a miller, speaks to
a landlady on the subject, and dies. Told in the
pure and simple, the unadorned and classical style,
this story would not have taken three pages, but
Mr. Tennyson has been able to make it the
principal&mdash;the largest tale in his new volume.
He has done so only by giving to every event
and incident in the volume an accompanying
commentary. He tells a great deal about the
torrid zone which a rough sailor like Enoch Arden
certainly would not have perceived; and he gives
to the fishing village, to which all the characters
belong, a softness and a fascination which such
villages scarcely possess in reality.</p>

<p>The description of the tropical island on which
the sailor is thrown, is an absolute model of
adorned art:</p>

<p class="noin">So much has not often been made of selling fish.</p>

<p>The essence of ornate art is in this manner to
accumulate round the typical object, everything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
which can be said about it, every associated
thought that can be connected with it without
impairing the essence of the delineation.</p>

<p>The first defect which strikes a student of
ornate art&mdash;the first which arrests the mere
reader of it&mdash;is what is called a want of simplicity.
Nothing is described as it is, everything has about
it an atmosphere of <i>something else</i>. The combined
and associated thoughts, though they set off and
heighten particular ideas and aspects of the
central conception, yet complicate it: a simple
thing&mdash;&#8216;a daisy by the river&#8217;s brim&#8217;&mdash;is never
left by itself, something else is put with it;
something not more connected with it than &#8216;lion-whelp&#8217;
and the &#8216;peacock yew-tree&#8217; are with the
&#8216;fresh fish for sale&#8217; that Enoch carries past them.
Even in the highest cases ornate art leaves upon
a cultured and delicate taste, the conviction that
it is not the highest art, that it is somehow
excessive and over-rich, that it is not chaste in
itself or chastening to the mind that sees it&mdash;that
it is in an unexplained manner unsatisfactory,
&#8216;a thing in which we feel there is some hidden
want!&#8217;</p>

<p>That want is a want of &#8216;definition&#8217;. We must
all know landscapes, river landscapes especially,
which are in the highest sense beautiful, which
when we first see them give us a delicate pleasure;
which in some&mdash;and these the best cases&mdash;give
even a gentle sense of surprise that such things
should be so beautiful, and yet when we come to
live in them, to spend even a few hours in them,
we seem stifled and oppressed. On the other hand
there are people to whom the sea-shore is a companion,
an exhilaration; and not so much for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
brawl of the shore as for the <i>limited</i> vastness, the
finite infinite of the ocean as they see it. Such
people often come home braced and nerved, and
if they spoke out the truth, would have only to say,
&#8216;We have seen the horizon line&#8217;; if they were let
alone indeed, they would gaze on it hour after
hour, so great to them is the fascination, so full
the sustaining calm, which they gain from that
union of form and greatness. To a very inferior
extent, but still, perhaps, to an extent which most
people understand better, a common arch will
have the same effect. A bridge completes a river
landscape; if of the old and many-arched sort it
regulates by a long series of defined forms the
vague outline of wood and river which before had
nothing to measure it; if of the new scientific
sort it introduces still more strictly a geometrical
element; it stiffens the scenery which was before
too soft, too delicate, too vegetable. Just such
is the effect of pure style in literary art. It calms
by conciseness; while the ornate style leaves on
the mind a mist of beauty, an excess of fascination,
a complication of charm, the pure style leaves
behind it the simple, defined, measured idea, as it
is, and by itself. That which is chaste chastens;
there is a poised energy&mdash;a state half thrill, and
half tranquillity&mdash;which pure art gives, which no
other can give; a pleasure justified as well as
felt; an ennobled satisfaction at what ought to
satisfy us, and must ennoble us.</p>

<p>Ornate art is to pure art what a painted statue
is to an unpainted. It is impossible to deny that
a touch of colour <i>does</i> bring out certain parts, does
convey certain expressions, does heighten certain
features, but it leaves on the work as a whole,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
a want, as we say, &#8216;of something&#8217;; a want of that
inseparable chasteness which clings to simple
sculpture, an impairing predominance of alluring
details which impairs our satisfaction with our
own satisfaction; which makes us doubt whether
a higher being than ourselves will be satisfied even
though we are so. In the very same manner,
though the <i>rouge</i> of ornate literature excites our
eye, it also impairs our confidence.</p>

<p>Mr. Arnold has justly observed that this self-justifying,
self-<i>proving</i> purity of style, is commoner
in ancient literature than in modern literature,
and also that Shakespeare is not a great or an
unmixed example of it. No one can say that he
is. His works are full of undergrowth, are full of
complexity, are not models of style; except by
a miracle nothing in the Elizabethan age could be
a model of style; the restraining taste of that age
was feebler and more mistaken than that of any
other equally great age. Shakespeare&#8217;s mind so
teemed with creation that he required the most
just, most forcible, most constant restraint from
without. He most needed to be guided of poets,
and he was the least and worst guided. As a whole
no one can call his works finished models of the
pure style, or of any style. But he has many
passages of the most pure style, passages which
could be easily cited if space served. And we
must remember that the task which Shakespeare
undertook was the most difficult which any poet
has ever attempted, and that it is a task in which
after a million efforts every other poet has failed.
The Elizabethan drama&mdash;as Shakespeare has immortalized
it&mdash;undertakes to delineate in five
acts, under stage restrictions, and in mere dialogue,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
a whole list of dramatis personae, a set of characters
enough for a modern novel, and with the distinctness
of a modern novel. Shakespeare is not content to
give two or three great characters in solitude and
in dignity, like the classical dramatists; he
wishes to give a whole <i>party</i> of characters in the
play of life, and according to the nature of each.
He would &#8216;hold the mirror up to nature&#8217;, not to
catch a monarch in a tragic posture, but a whole
group of characters engaged in many actions,
intent on many purposes, thinking many thoughts.
There is life enough, there is action enough, in
single plays of Shakespeare to set up an ancient
dramatist for a long career. And Shakespeare
succeeded. His characters, taken <i>en masse</i>, and
as a whole, are as well-known as any novelist&#8217;s
characters; cultivated men know all about them,
as young ladies know all about Mr. Trollope&#8217;s
novels. But no other dramatist has succeeded in
such an aim. No one else&#8217;s characters are staple
people in English literature, hereditary people
whom every one knows all about in every generation.
The contemporary dramatists, Beaumont
and Fletcher, Ben Jonson, Marlowe, &amp;c., had many
merits, some of them were great men. But a critic
must say of them the worst thing he has to say;
&#8216;they were men who failed in their characteristic
aim;&#8217; they attempted to describe numerous sets
of complicated characters, and they failed. No
one of such characters, or hardly one, lives in
common memory; the Faustus of Marlowe,
a really great idea, is not remembered. They
undertook to write what they could not write,
five acts full of real characters, and in consequence,
the fine individual things they conceived are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
forgotten by the mixed multitude, and known
only to a few of the few. Of the Spanish theatre
we cannot speak; but there are no such characters
in any French tragedy: the whole aim of that
tragedy forbade it. Goethe has added to literature
a few great characters; he may be said almost to
have added to literature the idea of &#8216;intellectual
creation&#8217;,&mdash;the idea of describing great characters
through the intellect; but he has not added to
the common stock what Shakespeare added, a
new <i>multitude</i> of men and women; and these not
in simple attitudes, but amid the most complex
parts of life, with all their various natures roused,
mixed, and strained. The severest art must have
allowed many details, much overflowing circumstance
to a poet who undertook to describe what
almost defies description. Pure art would have
<i>commanded</i> him to use details lavishly, for only
by a multiplicity of such could the required effect
have been at all produced. Shakespeare could
accomplish it, for his mind was a <i>spring</i>, an
inexhaustible fountain of human nature, and it
is no wonder that being compelled by the task
of his time to let the fullness of his nature overflow,
he sometimes let it overflow too much, and
covered with erroneous conceits and superfluous
images characters and conceptions which would
have been far more justly, far more effectually,
delineated with conciseness and simplicity. But
there is an infinity of pure art <i>in</i> Shakespeare,
although there is a great deal else also.</p>

<p>It will be said, if ornate art be as you say, an
inferior species or art, why should it ever be used?
If pure art be the best sort of art, why should it
not always be used?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span></p>

<p>The reason is this: literary art, as we just now
explained, is concerned with literatesque characters
in literatesque situations; and the <i>best</i> art is
concerned with the <i>most</i> literatesque characters in
the <i>most</i> literatesque situations. Such are the
subjects of pure art; it embodies with the fewest
touches, and under the most select and choice
circumstances, the highest conceptions; but it
does not follow that only the best subjects are to
be treated by art, and then only in the very best
way. Human nature could not endure such
a critical commandment as that, and it would be
an erroneous criticism which gave it. <i>Any</i> literatesque
character may be described in literature
under <i>any</i> circumstances which exhibit its literatesqueness.</p>

<p>The essence of pure art consists in its describing
what is as it is, and this is very well for what can
bear it, but there are many inferior things which
will not bear it, and which nevertheless ought to
be described in books. A certain kind of literature
deals with illusions, and this kind of literature
has given a colouring to the name romantic.
A man of rare genius, and even of poetical genius,
has gone so far as to make these illusions the true
subject of poetry&mdash;almost the sole subject.
&#8216;Without,&#8217; says Father Newman, of one of his
characters, &#8216;being himself a poet, he was in the
season of poetry, in the sweet spring-time, when
the year is most beautiful because it is new.
Novelty was beauty to a heart so open and cheerful
as his; not only because it was novelty, and had
its proper charm as such, but because when we
first see things, we see them in a gay confusion,
which is a principal element of the poetical.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
As time goes on, and we number and sort and
measure things,&mdash;as we gain views,&mdash;we advance
towards philosophy and truth, but we recede from
poetry.</p>

<p>&#8216;When we ourselves were young, we once on
a time walked on a hot summer-day from Oxford
to Newington&mdash;a dull road, as any one who has
gone it knows; yet it was new to us; and we
protest to you, reader, believe it or not, laugh or
not, as you will, to us it seemed on that occasion
quite touchingly beautiful; and a soft melancholy
came over us, of which the shadows fall even now,
when we look back upon that dusty, weary
journey. And why? because every object which
met us was unknown and full of mystery. A tree
or two in the distance seemed the beginning of
a great wood, or park, stretching endlessly;
a hill implied a vale beyond, with that vale&#8217;s
history; the bye-lanes, with their green hedges,
wound on and vanished, yet were not lost to the
imagination. Such was our first journey; but
when we had gone it several times, the mind
refused to act, the scene ceased to enchant, stern
reality alone remained; and we thought it one
of the most tiresome, odious roads we ever had
occasion to traverse.&#8217;</p>

<p>That is to say, that the function of the poet is to
introduce a &#8216;gay confusion&#8217;, a rich medley which
does not exist in the actual world&mdash;which perhaps
could not exist in any world&mdash;but which would
seem pretty if it did exist. Everyone who reads
<i>Enoch Arden</i> will perceive that this notion of all
poetry is exactly applicable to this one poem.
Whatever be made of Enoch&#8217;s &#8216;Ocean spoil in
ocean-smelling osier,&#8217; of the &#8216;portal-warding lion-whelp,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
and peacock yew-tree&#8217;, every one knows
that in himself Enoch could not have been
charming. People who sell fish about the country
(and that is what he did, though Mr. Tennyson
won&#8217;t speak out, and wraps it up) never are
beautiful. As Enoch was and must be coarse, in
itself the poem must depend for its charm on a &#8216;gay
confusion&#8217;&mdash;on a splendid accumulation of impossible
accessories.</p>

<p>Mr. Tennyson knows this better than many of us&mdash;he
knows the country world; he has proved it
that no one living knows it better; he has painted
with pure art&mdash;with art which describes what is
a race perhaps more refined, more delicate, more
conscientious, than the sailor&mdash;the &#8216;Northern
Farmer&#8217;, and we all know what a splendid, what
a living thing, he has made of it. He could, if he
only would, have given us the ideal sailor in like
manner&mdash;the ideal of the natural sailor we mean&mdash;the
characteristic present man as he lives and is.
But this he has not chosen. He has endeavoured
to describe an exceptional sailor, at an exceptionally
refined port, performing a graceful act, an act of
relinquishment. And with this task before him,
his profound taste taught him that ornate art was
a necessary medium&mdash;was the sole effectual
instrument&mdash;for his purpose. It was necessary
for him if possible to abstract the mind from
reality, to induce us <i>not</i> to conceive or think of
sailors as they are while we are reading of his
sailors, but to think of what a person who did not
know might fancy sailors to be. A casual traveller
on the sea-shore, with the sensitive mood and the
romantic imagination Mr. Newman has described,
might fancy, would fancy, a seafaring village to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
be like that. Accordingly, Mr. Tennyson has made
it his aim to call off the stress of fancy from real
life, to occupy it otherwise, to bury it with pretty
accessories; to engage it on the &#8216;peacock yew-tree&#8217;,
and the &#8216;portal-warding lion-whelp&#8217;. Nothing,
too, can be more splendid than the description
of the tropics as Mr. Tennyson delineates them,
but a sailor would not have felt the tropics in
that manner. The beauties of nature would not
have so much occupied him. He would have
known little of the scarlet shafts of sunrise and
nothing of the long convolvuluses. As in <i>Robinson
Crusoe</i>, his own petty contrivances and his small
ailments would have been the principal subject
to him. &#8216;For three years&#8217;, he might have said,
&#8216;my back was bad, and then I put two pegs into
a piece of drift wood and so made a chair, and
after that it pleased God to send me a chill.&#8217;
In real life his piety would scarcely have gone
beyond that.</p>

<p>It will indeed be said, that though the sailor had
no words for, and even no explicit consciousness of
the splendid details of the torrid zone, yet that he
had, notwithstanding, a dim latent inexpressible
conception of them: though he could not speak
of them or describe them, yet they were much
to him. And doubtless such is the case. Rude
people are impressed by what is beautiful&mdash;deeply
impressed&mdash;though they could not describe what
they see, or what they feel. But what is absurd
in Mr. Tennyson&#8217;s description&mdash;absurd when we
abstract it from the gorgeous additions and
ornaments with which Mr. Tennyson distracts us&mdash;is,
that his hero feels nothing else but these
great splendours. We hear nothing of the physical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
ailments, the rough devices, the low superstitions,
which really would have been the <i>first</i> things, the
favourite and principal occupations of his mind.
Just so when he gets home he <i>may</i> have had such
fine sentiments, though it is odd, and he <i>may</i> have
spoken of them to his landlady, though that is
odder still&mdash;but it is incredible that his whole
mind should be made up of fine sentiments. Beside
those sweet feelings, if he had them, there must have
been many more obvious, more prosaic, and some
perhaps more healthy. Mr. Tennyson has shown
a profound judgement in distracting us as he does.
He has given us a classic delineation of the
&#8216;Northern Farmer&#8217; with no ornament at all&mdash;as
bare a thing as can be&mdash;because he then wanted
to describe a true type of real men: he has given
us a sailor crowded all over with ornament and
illustration, because he then wanted to describe
an unreal type of fancied men, not sailors as
they are, but sailors as they might be wished.</p>

<p>Another prominent element in <i>Enoch Arden</i>
is yet more suitable to, yet more requires the aid
of, ornate art. Mr. Tennyson undertook to deal
with <i>half belief</i>. The presentiments which Annie
feels are exactly of that sort which everybody
has felt, and which every one has half believed&mdash;which
hardly any one has more than half believed.
Almost every one, it has been said, would be angry
if any one else reported that he believed in ghosts;
yet hardly any one, when thinking by himself,
wholly disbelieves them. Just so such presentiments
as Mr. Tennyson depicts, impress the inner
mind so much that the outer mind&mdash;the rational
understanding&mdash;hardly likes to consider them
nicely or to discuss them sceptically. For these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
dubious themes an ornate or complex style is
needful. Classical art speaks out what it has to
say plainly and simply. Pure style cannot hesitate;
it describes in concisest outline what is, as
it is. If a poet really believes in presentiments
he can speak out in pure style. One who could
have been a poet&mdash;one of the few in any age of
whom one can say certainly that they could have
been, and have not been&mdash;has spoken thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When Heaven sends sorrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Warnings go first,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lest it should burst<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With stunning might<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On souls too bright<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To fear the morrow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Can science bear us<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To the hid springs<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of human things?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Why may not dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or thought&#8217;s day-gleam,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Startle, yet cheer us?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Are such thoughts fetters,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">While faith disowns<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Dread of earth&#8217;s tones,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Recks but Heaven&#8217;s call,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And on the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Reads but Heaven&#8217;s letters?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But if a poet is not sure whether presentiments
are true or not true; if he wishes to leave his
readers in doubt; if he wishes an atmosphere of
indistinct illusion and of moving shadow, he must
use the romantic style, the style of miscellaneous
adjunct, the style &#8216;which shirks, not meets&#8217; your
intellect, the style which as you are scrutinizing
disappears.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor is this all, or even the principal lesson,
which <i>Enoch Arden</i> may suggest to us, of the
use of ornate art. That art is the appropriate art
for an <i>unpleasing type</i>. Many of the characters of
real life, if brought distinctly, prominently, and
plainly before the mind, as they really are, if
shown in their inner nature, their actual essence,
are doubtless very unpleasant. They would be
horrid to meet and horrid to think of. We fear it
must be owned that Enoch Arden is this kind
of person. A dirty sailor who did <i>not</i> go home to
his wife is not an agreeable being: a varnish must
be put on him to make him shine. It is true that
he acts rightly; that he is very good. But such
is human nature that it finds a little tameness in
mere morality. Mere virtue belongs to a charity
school-girl, and has a taint of the catechism.
All of us feel this, though most of us are too timid,
too scrupulous, too anxious about the virtue of
others, to speak out. We are ashamed of our
nature in this respect, but it is not the less our
nature. And if we look deeper into the matter
there are many reasons why we should not be
ashamed of it. The soul of man, and as we
necessarily believe of beings greater than man,
has many parts beside its moral part. It has an
intellectual part, an artistic part, even a religious
part, in which mere morals have no share. In
Shakespeare or Goethe, even in Newton or
Archimedes, there is much which will not be cut
down to the shape of the commandments. They
have thoughts, feelings, hopes&mdash;immortal thoughts
and hopes&mdash;which have influenced the life of men,
and the souls of men, ever since their age, but
which the &#8216;whole duty of man&#8217;, the ethical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
compendium, does not recognize. Nothing is
more unpleasant than a virtuous person with
a mean mind. A highly developed moral nature
joined to an undeveloped intellectual nature, an
undeveloped artistic nature, and a very limited
religious nature, is of necessity repulsive. It
represents a bit of human nature&mdash;a good bit, of
course, but a bit only&mdash;in disproportionate, unnatural,
and revolting prominence; and, therefore,
unless an artist use delicate care, we are offended.
The dismal act of a squalid man needed many
condiments to make it pleasant, and therefore
Mr. Tennyson was right to mix them subtly and to
use them freely.</p>

<p>A mere act of self-denial can indeed scarcely be
pleasant upon paper. An heroic struggle with an
external adversary, even though it end in a defeat,
may easily be made attractive. Human nature
likes to see itself look grand, and it looks grand
when it is making a brave struggle with foreign
foes. But it does not look grand when it is divided
against itself. An excellent person striving with
temptation is a very admirable being in reality,
but he is not a pleasant being in description.
We hope he will win and overcome his temptation,
but we feel that he would be a more interesting
being, a higher being, if he had not felt that
temptation so much. The poet must make the
struggle great in order to make the self-denial
virtuous, and if the struggle be too great, we are
apt to feel some mixture of contempt. The internal
metaphysics of a divided nature are but an inferior
subject for art, and if they are to be made attractive,
much else must be combined with them. If the
excellence of <i>Hamlet</i> had depended on the ethical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
qualities of Hamlet, it would not have been the
masterpiece of our literature. He acts virtuously
of course, and kills the people he ought to kill, but
Shakespeare knew that such goodness would not
much interest the pit. He made him a handsome
prince, and a puzzling meditative character;
these secular qualities relieve his moral excellence,
and so he becomes &#8216;nice&#8217;. In proportion as an
artist has to deal with types essentially imperfect,
he must disguise their imperfections; he must
accumulate around them as many first-rate
accessories as may make his readers forget that
they are themselves second-rate. The sudden
<i>millionaires</i> of the present day hope to disguise
their social defects by buying old places, and
hiding among aristocratic furniture; just so
a great artist who has to deal with characters
artistically imperfect will use an ornate style,
will fit them into a scene where there is much else
to look at.</p>

<p>For these reasons ornate art is within the limits
as legitimate as pure art. It does what pure art
could not do. The very excellence of pure art
confines its employment. Precisely because it
gives the best things by themselves and exactly
as they are, it fails when it is necessary to describe
inferior things among other things, with a list of
enhancements and a crowd of accompaniments
that in reality do not belong to it. Illusion, half
belief, unpleasant types, imperfect types, are as
much the proper sphere of ornate art, as an inferior
landscape is the proper sphere for the true efficacy
of moonlight. A really great landscape needs
sunlight and bears sunlight; but moonlight is an
equalizer of beauties; it gives a romantic unreality<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
to what will not stand the bare truth. And just so
does romantic art.</p>

<p>There is, however, a third kind of art which
differs from these on the point in which they
most resemble one another. Ornate art and pure
art have this in common, that they paint the types
of literature in as good perfection as they can.
Ornate art, indeed, uses undue disguises and unreal
enhancements; it does not confine itself to the best
types; on the contrary it is its office to make the best
of imperfect types and lame approximations; but
ornate art, as much as pure art, catches its subject
in the best light it can, takes the most developed
aspect of it which it can find, and throws upon it
the most congruous colours it can use. But
grotesque art does just the contrary. It takes
the type, so to say, <i>in difficulties</i>. It gives a
representation of it in its minimum development,
amid the circumstances least favourable to it,
just while it is struggling with obstacles, just
where it is encumbered with incongruities. It
deals, to use the language of science, not with
normal types but with abnormal specimens; to
use the language of old philosophy, not with what
nature is striving to be, but with what by some
lapse she has happened to become.</p>

<p>This art works by contrast. It enables you to
see, it makes you see, the perfect type by painting
the opposite deviation. It shows you what ought
to be by what ought not to be, when complete it
reminds you of the perfect image, by showing you
the distorted and imperfect image. Of this art
we possess in the present generation one prolific
master. Mr. Browning is an artist working by
incongruity. Possibly hardly one of his most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
considerable efforts can be found which is not
great because of its odd mixture. He puts together
things which no one else would have put together,
and produces on our minds a result which no one
else would have produced, or tried to produce.
His admirers may not like all we may have to say
of him. But in our way we too are among his
admirers. No one ever read him without seeing
not only his great ability but his great <i>mind</i>. He
not only possesses superficial useable talents, but
the strong something, the inner secret something
which uses them and controls them; he is great,
not in mere accomplishments, but in himself.
He has applied a hard strong intellect to real life;
he has applied the same intellect to the problems
of his age. He has striven to know what <i>is</i>: he
has endeavoured not to be cheated by counterfeits,
not to be infatuated with illusions. His heart is
in what he says. He has battered his brain against
his creed till he believes it. He has accomplishments
too, the more effective because they are mixed.
He is at once a student of mysticism, and a citizen
of the world. He brings to the club sofa distinct
visions of old creeds, intense images of strange
thoughts: he takes to the bookish student tidings
of wild Bohemia, and little traces of the <i>demi-monde</i>.
He puts down what is good for the naughty and
what is naughty for the good. Over women his
easier writings exercise that imperious power
which belongs to the writings of a great man of
the world upon such matters. He knows women, and
therefore they wish to know him. If we blame
many of Browning&#8217;s efforts, it is in the interest of
art, and not from a wish to hurt or degrade him.</p>

<p>If we wanted to illustrate the nature of grotesque<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
art by an exaggerated instance we should have
selected a poem which the chance of late publication
brings us in this new volume. Mr. Browning
has undertaken to describe what may be called <i>mind
in difficulties</i>&mdash;mind set to make out the universe
under the worst and hardest circumstances. He
takes &#8216;Caliban&#8217;, not perhaps exactly Shakespeare&#8217;s
Caliban, but an analogous and worse creature;
a strong thinking power, but a nasty creature&mdash;a
gross animal, uncontrolled and unelevated by
any feeling of religion or duty. The delineation
of him will show that Mr. Browning does not wish
to take undue advantage of his readers by a choice
of nice subjects.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8217;Will sprawl, now that the heat of day is best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flat on his belly in the pit&#8217;s much mire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With elbows wide, fists clenched to prop his chin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, while he kicks both feet in the cool slush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feels about his spine small eft-things course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Run in and out each arm, and make him laugh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while above his head a pompion-plant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coating the cave-top as a brow its eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Creeps down to touch and tickle hair and beard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now a flower drops with a bee inside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now a fruit to snap at, catch and crunch:<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This pleasant creature proceeds to give his idea
of the origin of the Universe, and it is as follows.
Caliban speaks in the third person, and is of
opinion that the maker of the Universe took to
making it on account of his personal discomfort:</p>

<p>It may seem perhaps to most readers that these
lines are very difficult, and that they are unpleasant.
And so they are. We quote them to illustrate, not
the <i>success</i> of grotesque art, but the <i>nature</i> of
grotesque art. It shows the end at which this
species of art aims, and if it fails, it is from over-boldness
in the choice of a subject by the artist,
or from the defects of its execution. A thinking
faculty more in difficulties&mdash;a great type,&mdash;an
inquisitive, searching intellect under more disagreeable
conditions, with worse helps, more likely
to find falsehood, less likely to find truth, can
scarcely be imagined. Nor is the mere description<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
of the thought at all bad: on the contrary, if we
closely examine it, it is very clever. Hardly
any one could have amassed so many ideas at once
nasty and suitable. But scarcely any readers&mdash;any
casual readers&mdash;who are not of the sect of
Mr. Browning&#8217;s admirers will be able to examine
it enough to appreciate it. From a defect, partly
of subject, and partly of style, many of Mr. Browning&#8217;s
works make a demand upon the reader&#8217;s
zeal and sense of duty to which the nature of
most readers is unequal. They have on the turf
the convenient expression &#8216;staying power&#8217;: some
horses can hold on and others cannot. But hardly
any reader not of especial and peculiar nature
can hold on through such composition. There
is not enough of &#8216;staying power&#8217; in human nature.
One of his greatest admirers once owned to us that
he seldom or never began a new poem without
looking on in advance, and foreseeing with caution
what length of intellectual adventure he was about
to commence. Whoever will work hard at such
poems will find much mind in them: they are
a sort of quarry of ideas, but whoever goes there
will find these ideas in such a jagged, ugly, useless
shape that he can hardly bear them.</p>

<p>We are not judging Mr. Browning simply from
a hasty recent production. All poets are liable to
misconceptions, and if such a piece as <i>Caliban
upon Setebos</i> were an isolated error, a venial and
particular exception, we should have given it no
prominence. We have put it forward because it
just elucidates both our subject and the characteristics
of Mr. Browning. But many other of his
best known pieces do so almost equally; what
several of his devotees think his best piece is quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
enough illustrative for anything we want. It
appears that on Holy Cross day at Rome the Jews
were obliged to listen to a Christian sermon in
the hope of their conversion, though this is,
according to Mr. Browning, what they really said
when they came away:</p>

<span class="i0">Take the church-road, for the bell&#8217;s due chime<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Shame, man! greedy beyond your years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To handsel the bishop&#8217;s shaving-shears?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair play&#8217;s a jewel! leave friends in the lurch?<br /></span>

<p>It is very natural that a poet whose wishes
incline, or whose genius conducts him to a grotesque
art, should be attracted towards mediaeval
subjects. There is no age whose legends are
so full of grotesque subjects, and no age where
real life was so fit to suggest them. Then, more
than at any other time, good principles have been
under great hardships. The vestiges of ancient civilization,
the germs of modern civilization, the little
remains of what had been, the small beginnings
of what is, were buried under a cumbrous mass of
barbarism and cruelty. Good elements hidden in
horrid accompaniments are the special theme of
grotesque art, and these mediaeval life and legends
afford more copiously than could have been furnished
before Christianity gave its new elements
of good, or since modern civilization has removed
some few at least of the old elements of destruction.
A <i>buried</i> life like the spiritual mediaeval was
Mr. Browning&#8217;s natural element, and he was right
to be attracted by it. His mistake has been, that
he has not made it pleasant; that he has forced
his art to topics on which no one could charm, or
on which he, at any rate, could not; that on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
these occasions and in these poems he has failed in
fascinating men and women of sane taste.</p>

<p>We say &#8216;sane&#8217; because there is a most formidable
and estimable <i>insane</i> taste. The will has great
though indirect power over the taste, just as it
has over the belief. There are some horrid beliefs
from which human nature revolts, from which at
first it shrinks, to which, at first, no effort can
force it. But if we fix the mind upon them they
have a power over us just because of their natural
offensiveness. They are like the sight of human
blood: experienced soldiers tell us that at first
men are sickened by the smell and newness of
blood almost to death and fainting, but that as
soon as they harden their hearts and stiffen their
minds, as soon as they <i>will</i> bear it, then comes an
appetite for slaughter, a tendency to gloat on
carnage, to love blood, at least for the moment,
with a deep eager love. It is a principle that if
we put down a healthy instinctive aversion, nature
avenges herself by creating an unhealthy insane
attraction. For this reason the most earnest
truth-seeking men fall into the worst delusions;
they will not let their mind alone; they force it
towards some ugly thing, which a crotchet of
argument, a conceit of intellect recommends, and
nature punishes their disregard of her warning by
subjection to the ugly one, by belief in it. Just so
the most industrious critics get the most admiration.
They think it unjust to rest in their instinctive
natural horror: they overcome it, and angry
nature gives them over to ugly poems and marries
them to detestable stanzas.</p>

<p>Mr. Browning possibly, and some of the worst
of Mr. Browning&#8217;s admirers certainly, will say that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
these grotesque objects exist in real life, and
therefore they ought to be, at least may be,
described in art. But though pleasure is not the
end of poetry, pleasing is a condition of poetry.
An exceptional monstrosity of horrid ugliness
cannot be made pleasing, except it be made to
suggest&mdash;to recall&mdash;the perfection, the beauty,
from which it is a deviation. Perhaps in extreme
cases no art is equal to this; but then such self-imposed
problems should not be worked by the
artist; these out-of-the-way and detestable subjects
should be let alone by him. It is rather
characteristic of Mr. Browning to neglect this
rule. He is the most of a realist, and the least
of an idealist of any poet we know. He evidently
sympathizes with some part at least of Bishop
Blougram&#8217;s apology. Anyhow this world exists.
&#8216;There <i>is</i> good wine&mdash;there <i>are</i> pretty women&mdash;there
<i>are</i> comfortable benefices&mdash;there <i>is</i> money,
and it is pleasant to spend it. Accept the creed
of your age and you get these, reject that creed and
you lose them. And for what do you lose them?
For a fancy creed of your own, which no one else
will accept, which hardly any one will call a &#8220;creed&#8221;,
which most people will consider a sort of unbelief.&#8217;
Again, Mr. Browning evidently loves what we
may call the realism, the grotesque realism, of
orthodox christianity. Many parts of it in which
great divines have felt keen difficulties are quite
pleasant to him. He must <i>see</i> his religion, he must
nave an &#8216;object-lesson&#8217; in believing. He must
have a creed that will <i>take</i>, which wins and holds
the miscellaneous world, which stout men will heed,
which nice women will adore. The spare moments
of solitary religion&mdash;the &#8216;obdurate questionings&#8217;,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
the high &#8216;instincts&#8217;, the &#8216;first affections&#8217;, the
&#8216;shadowy recollections&#8217;,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Which, do they what they may,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are yet the fountain-light of all our day&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are yet a master-light of all our seeing;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">the great but vague faith&mdash;the unutterable tenets
seem to him worthless, visionary; they are not
enough immersed in matter; they move about
&#8216;in worlds not realized&#8217;. We wish he could be
tried like the prophet once; he would have found
God in the earthquake and the storm; he could
have deciphered from them a bracing and a rough
religion: he would have known that crude men
and ignorant women felt them too, and he would
accordingly have trusted them; but he would
have distrusted and disregarded the &#8216;still small
voice&#8217;; he would have said it was &#8216;fancy&#8217;&mdash;a
thing you thought you heard to-day, but were not
sure you had heard to-morrow: he would call it a
nice illusion, an immaterial prettiness; he would
ask triumphantly &#8216;How are you to get the mass of
men to heed this little thing?&#8217; he would have persevered
and insisted &#8216;<i>My wife</i> does not hear it&#8217;.</p>

<p>But although a suspicion of beauty, and a taste
for ugly reality, have led Mr. Browning to exaggerate
the functions, and to caricature the nature of
grotesque art, we own or rather we maintain that
he has given many excellent specimens of that art
within its proper boundaries and limits. Take an
example, his picture of what we may call the
<i>bourgeois</i> nature in <i>difficulties</i>; in the utmost
difficulty, in contact with magic and the supernatural.
He has made of it something homely,
comic, true; reminding us of what <i>bourgeois</i>
nature really is. By showing us the type under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
abnormal conditions, he reminds us of the type
under its best and most satisfactory conditions&mdash;</p>

<p>Something more we had to say of Mr. Browning,
but we must stop. It is singularly characteristic
of this age that the poems which rise to the surface
should be examples of ornate art, and grotesque
art, not of pure art. We live in the realm of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
<i>half</i> educated. The number of readers grows daily,
but the quality of readers does not improve rapidly.
The middle class is scattered, headless; it is well-meaning
but aimless; wishing to be wise, but
ignorant how to be wise. The aristocracy of England
never was a literary aristocracy, never even
in the days of its full power, of its unquestioned
predominance, did it guide&mdash;did it even seriously
try to guide&mdash;the taste of England. Without
guidance young men and tired men are thrown
amongst a mass of books; they have to choose
which they like; many of them would much like
to improve their culture, to chasten their taste,
if they knew how. But left to themselves they
take, not pure art, but showy art; not that which
permanently relieves the eye and makes it happy
whenever it looks, and as long as it looks, but
<i>glaring</i> art which catches and arrests the eye for
a moment, but which in the end fatigues it. But
before the wholesome remedy of nature&mdash;the
fatigue&mdash;arrives, the hasty reader has passed on to
some new excitement, which in its turn stimulates
for an instant, and then is passed by for ever.
These conditions are not favourable to the due
appreciation of pure art&mdash;of that art which must
be known before it is admired&mdash;which must have
fastened irrevocably on the brain before you
appreciate it&mdash;which you must love ere it will
seem worthy of your love. Women too, whose
voice in literature counts as well as that of men&mdash;and
in a light literature counts for more than that
of men&mdash;women, such as we know them, such as
they are likely to be, ever prefer a delicate unreality
to a true or firm art. A dressy literature,
an exaggerated literature seem to be fated to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
us. These are our curses, as other times had
theirs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Forms</span> of intellectual and spiritual culture often
exercise their subtlest and most artful charm when
life is already passing from them. Searching and
irresistible as are the changes of the human spirit
on its way to perfection, there is yet so much
elasticity of temper that what must pass away
sooner or later is not disengaged all at once even
from the highest order of minds. Nature, which by
one law of development evolves ideas, moralities,
modes of inward life, and represses them in turn,
has in this way provided that the earlier growth
should propel its fibres into the later, and so transmit
the whole of its forces in an unbroken continuity
of life. Then comes the spectacle of the
reserve of the elder generation exquisitely refined
by the antagonism of the new. That current of
new life chastens them as they contend against it.
Weaker minds do not perceive the change; clearer
minds abandon themselves to it. To feel the
change everywhere, yet not to abandon oneself to
it, is a situation of difficulty and contention. Communicating
in this way to the passing stage of
culture the charm of what is chastened, high-strung,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
athletic, they yet detach the highest minds from
the past by pressing home its difficulties and finally
proving it impossible. Such is the charm of
Julian, of St. Louis, perhaps of Luther; in the
narrower compass of modern times, of Dr. Newman
and Lacordaire; it is also the peculiar charm of
Coleridge.</p>

<p>Modern thought is distinguished from ancient
by its cultivation of the &#8216;relative&#8217; spirit in place of
the &#8216;absolute&#8217;. Ancient philosophy sought to
arrest every object in an eternal outline, to fix
thought in a necessary formula, and types of life
in a classification by &#8216;kinds&#8217; or <i>genera</i>. To the
modern spirit nothing is, or can be rightly known
except relatively under conditions. An ancient
philosopher indeed started a philosophy of the
relative, but only as an enigma. So the germs of
almost all philosophical ideas were enfolded in the
mind of antiquity, and fecundated one by one in
after ages by the external influences of art, religion,
culture in the natural sciences, belonging to a particular
generation, which suddenly becomes preoccupied
by a formula or theory, not so much new
as penetrated by a new meaning and expressiveness.
So the idea of &#8216;the relative&#8217; has been
fecundated in modern times by the influence of
the sciences of observation. These sciences reveal
types of life evanescing into each other by inexpressible
refinements of change. Things pass into
their opposites by accumulation of undefinable
quantities. The growth of those sciences consists
in a continual analysis of facts of rough and general
observation into groups of facts more precise and
minute. A faculty for truth is a power of distinguishing
and fixing delicate and fugitive details.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
The moral world is ever in contact with the physical;
the relative spirit has invaded moral philosophy
from the ground of the inductive science.
There it has started a new analysis of the relations
of body and mind, good and evil, freedom and
necessity. Hard and abstract moralities are yielding
to a more exact estimate of the subtlety and
complexity of our life. Always, as an organism
increases in perfection the conditions of its life
become more complex. Man is the most complex
of the products of nature. Character merges into
temperament; the nervous system refines itself
into intellect. His physical organism is played
upon not only by the physical conditions about it,
but by remote laws of inheritance, the vibrations
of long past acts reaching him in the midst of the
new order of things in which he lives. When we
have estimated these conditions he is not yet simple
and isolated; for the mind of the race, the character
of the age, sway him this way or that through the
medium of language and ideas. It seems as if the
most opposite statements about him were alike
true; he is so receptive, all the influences of the
world and of society ceaselessly playing upon him,
so that every hour in his life is unique, changed
altogether by a stray word, or glance, or touch.
The truth of these relations experience gives us;
not the truth of eternal outlines effected once for all,
but a world of fine gradations and subtly linked
conditions, shifting intricately as we ourselves
change; and bids us by constant clearing of the
organs of observation and perfecting of analysis
to make what we can of these. To the intellect, to
the critical spirit, these subtleties of effect are more
precious than anything else. What is lost in precision<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
of form is gained in intricacy of expression.
To suppose that what is called &#8216;ontology&#8217; is what
the speculative instinct seeks, is the misconception
of a backward school of logicians. Who would
change the colour or curve of a roseleaf for that
&#959;&#8016;&#963;&#8055;&#945; &#7936;&#967;&#961;&#8061;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;, &#7936;&#963;&#967;&#951;&#956;&#8049;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962;, &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#966;&#8053;&#962;. A transcendentalism
that makes what is abstract more
excellent than what is concrete has nothing akin to
the leading philosophies of the world. The true
illustration of the speculative temper is not the
Hindoo, lost to sense, understanding, individuality;
but such an one as Goethe, to whom every moment
of life brought its share of experimental,
individual knowledge, by whom no touch of the
world of form, colour, and passion was disregarded.</p>

<p>The literary life of Coleridge was a disinterested
struggle against the application of the relative
spirit to moral and religious questions. Everywhere
he is restlessly scheming to apprehend the
absolute; to affirm it effectively; to get it acknowledged.
Coleridge failed in that attempt, happily
even for him, for it was a struggle against the
increasing life of the mind itself. The real loss
was, that this controversial interest betrayed him
into a direction which was not for him the path
of the highest intellectual success; a direction in
which his artistic talent could never find the conditions
of its perfection. Still, there is so much
witchery about his poems, that it is as a poet that
he will most probably be permanently remembered.
How did his choice of a controversial interest, his
determination to affirm the absolute, weaken or
modify his poetical gift?</p>

<p>In 1798 he joined Wordsworth in the composition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
of a volume of poems&mdash;the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>.
What Wordsworth then wrote is already vibrant
with that blithe <i>&eacute;lan</i> which carried him to final
happiness and self-possession. In Coleridge we
feel already that faintness and obscure dejection
which cling like some contagious damp to all his
writings. Wordsworth was to be distinguished by
a joyful and penetrative conviction of the existence
of certain latent affinities between nature and the
human mind, which reciprocally gild the mind and
nature with a kind of &#8216;heavenly alchemy&#8217;:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">... My voice proclaims<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How exquisitely the individual mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(And the progressive powers perhaps no less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the whole species) to the external world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is fitted:&mdash;and how exquisitely, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The external world is fitted to the mind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the creation, by no lower name<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>In Wordsworth this took the form of an unbroken
dreaming over the aspects and transitions of nature,
a reflective, but altogether unformulated, analysis
of them.</p>

<p>There are in Coleridge&#8217;s poems expressions of
this conviction as deep as Wordsworth&#8217;s. But
Coleridge could never have abandoned himself to
the dream as Wordsworth did, because the first
condition of such abandonment is an unvexed
quietness of heart. No one can read the <i>Lines
composed above Tintern</i> without feeling how
potent the physical element was among the conditions
of Wordsworth&#8217;s genius:&mdash;&#8216;felt in the
blood and felt along the heart,&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;My whole life
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>I have lived in quiet thought.&#8217; The stimulus
which most artists require from nature he can
renounce. He leaves the ready-made glory of the
Swiss mountains to reflect a glory on a mouldering
leaf. He loves best to watch the floating thistledown,
because of its hint at an unseen life in the
air. Coleridge&#8217;s temperament, &#7936;&#949;&#8054; &#7952;&#957; &#963;&#966;&#959;&#948;&#961;&#8119; &#8000;&#961;&#8051;&#958;&#949;&#953;,
with its faintness, its grieved dejection,
could never have been like that.</p>

</div></div>

<p>It is that flawless temperament in Wordsworth
which keeps his conviction of a latent intelligence
in nature within the limits of sentiment or instinct,
and confines it, to those delicate and subdued
shades of expression which perfect art allows. In
sadder dispositions, that is in the majority of cases,
where such a conviction has existed, it has stiffened
into a formula, it has frozen into a scientific or
pseudo-scientific theory. For the perception of
those affinities brings one so near the absorbing
speculative problems of life&mdash;optimism, the proportion
of man to his place in nature, his prospects
in relation to it&mdash;that it ever tends to become
theory through their contagion. Even in Goethe,
who has brilliantly handled the subject in his
lyrics entitled <i>Gott und Welt</i>, it becomes something
stiffer than poetry; it is tempered by the
&#8216;pale cast&#8217; of his technical knowledge of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
nature of colours, of anatomy, of the metamorphosis
of plants.</p>

<p>That, however, which had only a limited power
over Coleridge as sentiment, entirely possessed
him as a philosophical idea. We shall see in what
follows how deep its power was, how it pursued him
everywhere, and seemed to him to interpret every
question. Wordsworth&#8217;s poetry is an optimism;
it says man&#8217;s relation to the world is, and may be
seen by man to be, a perfect relation; but it is
an optimism that begins and ends in an abiding
instinct. Coleridge accepts the same optimism as
a philosophical idea, but an idea is relative to an
intellectual assent; sometimes it seems a better
expression of facts, sometimes a worse, as the
understanding weighs it in the logical balances.
And so it is not a permanent consolation. It is
only in the rarer moments of intellectual warmth
and sunlight that it is entirely credible. In less
exhilarating moments that perfect relation of man
and nature seems to shift and fail; that is, the
philosophical idea ceases to be realizable; and
with Coleridge its place is not supplied, as with
Wordsworth, by the corresponding sentiment or
instinct.</p>

<p>What in Wordsworth is a sentiment or instinct,
is in Coleridge a philosophical idea. In other
words, Coleridge&#8217;s talent is a more intellectual one
than Wordsworth&#8217;s, more dramatic, more self-conscious.
Wordsworth&#8217;s talent, deeply reflective
as it is, because its base is an instinct, is deficient
in self-knowledge. Possessed by the rumours and
voices of the haunted country, the borders of
which he has passed alone, he never thinks of
withdrawing from it to look down upon it from one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
of the central heights of human life. His power
absorbs him, not he it; he cannot turn it round or
get without it; he does not estimate its general
relation to life. But Coleridge, just because the
essence of his talent is the intuition of an idea,
commands his talent. He not only feels with
Wordsworth the expression of mind in nature, but
he can project that feeling outside him, reduce it to
a psychological law, define its relation to other
elements of culture, place it in a complete view
of life.</p>

<p>And in some such activity as that, varied as his
wide learning, in a many-sided dramatic kind of
poetry, assigning its place and value to every mode
of the inward life, seems to have been for Coleridge
the original path of artistic success. But in order
to follow that path one must hold ideas loosely in
the relative spirit, not seek to stereotype any one
of the many modes of that life; one must acknowledge
that the mind is ever greater than its own
products, devote ideas to the service of art rather
than of &#947;&#957;&#8182;&#963;&#953;&#962;, not disquiet oneself about the
absolute. Perhaps Coleridge is more interesting
because he did not follow this path. Repressing
his artistic interest and voluntarily discolouring
his own work, he turned to console and strengthen
the human mind, vulgarized or dejected, as he
believed, by the acquisition of new knowledge
about itself in the <i>&eacute;claircissement</i> of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>What the reader of our own generation will least
find in Coleridge&#8217;s prose writings is the excitement
of the literary sense. And yet in those grey
volumes we have the production of one who made
way ever by a charm, the charm of voice, of aspect,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
of language, above all, by the intellectual charm of
new, moving, luminous ideas. Perhaps the chief
offence in Coleridge is an excess of seriousness,
a seriousness that arises not from any moral
principle, but from a misconception of the perfect
manner. There is a certain shade of levity and
unconcern, the perfect manner of the eighteenth
century, which marks complete culture in the
handling of abstract questions. The humanist,
he who possesses that complete culture, does not
&#8216;weep&#8217; over the failure of &#8216;a theory of the quantification
of the predicate&#8217;, nor &#8216;shriek&#8217; over the fall
of a philosophical formula. A kind of humour
is one of the conditions of the true mental attitude
in the criticism of past stages of thought. Humanity
cannot afford to be too serious about them, any
more than a man of good sense can afford to be too
serious in looking back upon his own childhood.
Plato, whom Coleridge claims as the first of his
spiritual ancestors, Plato, as we remember him,
a true humanist, with Petrarch and Goethe and
M. Renan, holds his theories lightly, glances with
a blithe and na&iuml;ve inconsequence from one view to
another, not anticipating the burden of meaning
&#8216;views&#8217; will one day have for humanity. In
reading him one feels how lately it was that Croesus
thought it a paradox to say that external prosperity
was not necessarily happiness. But on
Coleridge lies the whole weight of the sad reflection
that has since come into the world, with which for
us the air is full, which the children in the market-place
repeat to each other. Even his language
is forced and broken, lest some saving formula
should be lost&mdash;&#8216;distinctities&#8217;, &#8216;enucleation&#8217;,
&#8216;pentad of operative Christianity&#8217;&mdash;he has a whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
vocabulary of such phrases, and expects to turn the
tide of human thought by fixing the sense of such
expressions as &#8216;reason&#8217;, &#8216;understanding&#8217;, &#8216;idea&#8217;.</p>

<p>Again, he has not the jealousy of the true artist
in excluding all associations that have no charm
or colour or gladness in them; everywhere he
allows the impress of an inferior theological
literature; he is often prolix and importunate
about most indifferent heroes&mdash;Sir Alexander Ball,
Dr. Bell, even Dr. Bowyer, the coarse pedant of the
Blue-coat School. And the source of all this is
closely connected with the source of his literary
activity. For Coleridge had chosen as the mark of
his literary egotism a kind of intellectual <i>tour de
force</i>&mdash;to found a religious philosophy, to do something
with the &#8216;idea&#8217; in spite of the essential nature
of the &#8216;idea&#8217;. And therefore all is fictitious from
the beginning. He had determined, that which
is humdrum, insipid, which the human spirit has
done with, shall yet stimulate and inspire. What
he produced symbolizes this purpose&mdash;the mass
of it <i>ennuyant</i>, depressing: the <i>Aids to Reflection</i>,
for instance, with Archbishop Leighton&#8217;s vague
pieties all twisted into the jargon of a spiritualistic
philosophy. But sometimes &#8216;the pulse of the
God&#8217;s blood&#8217; does transmute it, kindling here and
there a spot that begins to live; as in that beautiful
fragment at the end of the <i>Church and State</i>, or
in the distilled and concentrated beauty of such
a passage as this:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The first range of hills, that encircles the scanty vale of
human life, is the horizon for the majority of its inhabitants.
On its ridges the common sun is born and departs. From
them the stars rise, and touching them they vanish. By
the many, even this range, the natural limit and bulwark of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
the vale, is but imperfectly known. Its higher ascents are
too often hidden by mists and clouds from uncultivated
swamps, which few have courage or curiosity to penetrate.
To the multitude below these vapours appear now as the
dark haunts of terrific agents, on which none may intrude
with impunity; and now all a-glow, with colours not their
own, they are gazed at as the splendid palaces of happiness
and power. But in all ages there have been a few who,
measuring and sounding the rivers of the vale at the feet
of their furthest inaccessible falls, have learned that the
sources must be far higher and far inward; a few who,
even in the level streams, have detected elements which
neither the vale itself nor the surrounding mountains
contained or could supply.</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Biographia Literaria.</i></p></div>

<p>&#8216;I was driven from life in motion to life in
thought and sensation.&#8217; So Coleridge sums up his
childhood with its delicacy, its sensitiveness, and
passion. From his tenth to his eighteenth year
he was at a rough school in London. Speaking of
this time, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When I was first plucked up and transplanted from my
birthplace and family, Providence, it has often occurred
to me, gave me the first intimation that it was my lot, and
that it was best for me, to make or find my way of life
a detached individual, a <i>terrae filius</i>, who was to ask love
or service of no one on any more specific relation than that
of being a man, and as such to take my chance for the free
charities of humanity.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p></div>

<p>Even his fine external nature was for years
repressed, wronged, driven inward&mdash;&#8216;at fourteen
I was in a continual state of low fever.&#8217; He
becomes a dreamer, an eager student, but without
ambition.</p>

<p>This depressed boy is nevertheless, on the spiritual
side, the child of a noble house. At twenty-five he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>is exercising a wonderful charm, and has defined for
himself a peculiar line of intellectual activity. He
had left Cambridge without a degree, a Unitarian.
Unable to take orders, he determined through
Southey&#8217;s influence to devote himself to literature.
When he left Cambridge there was a prejudice
against him which has given occasion to certain
suspicions. Those who knew him best discredit
these suspicions. What is certain is that he was
subject to fits of violent, sometimes fantastic,
despondency. He retired to Stowey, in Somersetshire,
to study poetry and philosophy. In 1797
his poetical gift was in full flower; he wrote
<i>Kubla Khan</i>, the first part of <i>Christabel</i>, and <i>The
Ancient Mariner</i>. His literary success grew in
spite of opposition. He had a strange attractive
gift of conversation, or rather of monologue, as De
Stael said, full of <i>bizarrerie</i>, with the rapid alternations
of a dream, and here and there a sudden
summons into a world strange to the hearer,
abounding with images drawn from a sort of
divided, imperfect life, as of one to whom the
external world penetrated only in part, and, blended
with all this, passages of the deepest obscurity,
precious only for their musical cadence, the echo
in Coleridge of the eloquence of the older English
writers, of whom he was so ardent a lover. All
through this brilliant course we may discern the
power of the Asiatic temperament, of that voluptuousness
which is perhaps connected with his
appreciation of the intimacy, the almost mystical
<i>rapport</i>, between man and nature. &#8216;I am much
better&#8217;, he writes, &#8216;and my new and tender health
is all over me like a voluptuous feeling.&#8217;</p>

<p>And whatever fame, or charm, or life-inspiring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
gift he has had is the vibration of the interest he
excited then, the propulsion into years that
clouded his early promise of that first buoyant,
irresistible self-assertion: so great is even the
indirect power of a sincere effort towards the ideal
life, of even a temporary escape of the spirit from
routine. Perhaps the surest sign of his election&mdash;that
he was indeed, on the spiritual side, the child
of a noble house&mdash;is that story of the Pantisocratic
scheme, which at this distance looks so grotesque.
In his enthusiasm for the French Revolution, the
old communistic dream with its appeal to nature
(perhaps a little theatrical), touched him, as it had
touched Rousseau, Saint-Pierre, and Chateaubriand.
He had married one, his affection for whom seems
to have been only a passing feeling; with her and
a few friends he was to found a communistic settlement
on the banks of the Susquehannah&mdash;&#8216;the
name was pretty and metrical.&#8217; It was one of
Coleridge&#8217;s lightest dreams; but also one which
could only have passed through the liberal air of his
earlier life. The later years of the French Revolution,
which for us have discredited all such dreams,
deprived him of that youthfulness which is the
preservative element in a literary talent.</p>

<p>In 1798, he visited Germany. A beautiful fragment
of this period remains, describing a spring
excursion to the Brocken. His excitement still
vibrates in it. Love, all joyful states of mind, are
self-expressive; they loosen the tongue, they fill
the thoughts with sensuous images, they harmonize
one with the world of sight. We hear of the &#8216;rich
graciousness and courtesy&#8217; of Coleridge&#8217;s manner,
of the white and delicate skin, the abundant black
hair, the full, almost animal lips, that whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
physiognomy of the dreamer already touched with
fanaticism. One says of the text of one of his
Unitarian sermons, &#8216;his voice rose like a stream of
rich distilled perfumes&#8217;; another, &#8216;he talks like
an angel, and does&mdash;nothing.&#8217;</p>

<p>Meantime, he had designed an intellectual novelty
in the shape of a religious philosophy. Socinian
theology and the philosophy of Hartley had become
distasteful. &#8216;Whatever is against right reason,
that no faith can oblige us to believe.&#8217; Coleridge
quotes these words from Jeremy Taylor. And yet
ever since the dawn of the Renaissance, had subsisted
a conflict between reason and faith. From
the first, indeed, the Christian religion had affirmed
the existence of such a conflict, and had even based
its plea upon its own weakness in it. In face of the
classical culture, with its deep wide-struck roots in
the world as it permanently exists, St. Paul asserted
the claims of that which could not appeal with
success to any genuinely human principle. Paradox
as it was, that was the strength of the new spirit;
for how much is there at all times in humanity
which cannot appeal with success for encouragement
or tolerance to any genuinely human principle.
In the Middle Ages it might seem that faith
had reconciled itself to philosophy; the Catholic
church was the leader of the world&#8217;s life as well as
of the spirit&#8217;s. Looking closer we see that the conflict
is still latent there; the supremacy of faith is
only a part of the worship of sorrow and weakness
which marks the age. The weak are no longer
merely a majority, they are all Europe. It is not
that faith has become one with reason; but
a strange winter, a strange suspension of life, has
passed over the classical culture which is only the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
human reason in its most trenchant form. Glimpse
after glimpse, as that pagan culture awoke to life,
the conflict was felt once more. It is at the court
of Frederick II that the Renaissance first becomes
discernible as an actual power in European society.
How definite and unmistakable is the attitude of
faith towards that! Ever since the Reformation
all phases of theology had been imperfect philosophies&mdash;that
is, in which there was a religious
<i>arri&egrave;re pens&eacute;e</i>; philosophies which could never be
in the ascendant in a sincerely scientific sphere.
The two elements had never really mixed. Writers
so different as Locke and Taylor have each his
liberal philosophy, and each has his defence of the
orthodox belief; but, also, each has a divided
mind; we wonder how the two elements could
have existed side by side; brought together in
a single mind, but unable to fuse in it, they reveal
their radical contrariety. The Catholic church
and humanity are two powers that divide the
intellect and spirit of man. On the Catholic side
is faith, rigidly logical as Ultramontanism, with
a proportion of the facts of life, that is, all that is
despairing in life coming naturally under its
formula. On the side of humanity is all that is
desirable in the world, all that is sympathetic
with its laws, and succeeds through that sympathy.
Doubtless, for the individual, there are a thousand
intermediate shades of opinion, a thousand resting-places
for the religious spirit; still, &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#953;&#959;&#961;&#8055;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#8182;&#957;,
fine distinctions are not for
the majority; and this makes time eventually
a dogmatist, working out the opposition in its
most trenchant form, and fixing the horns of the
dilemma; until, in the present day, we have on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
one side Pius IX, the true descendant of the
fisherman, issuing the Encyclical, pleading the old
promise against the world with a special kind of
justice; and on the other side, the irresistible
modern culture, which, as religious men often
remind us, is only Christian accidentally.</p>

<p>The peculiar temper of Coleridge&#8217;s intellect made
the idea of reconciling this conflict very seductive.
With a true speculative talent he united a false
kind of subtlety and the full share of vanity.
A dexterous intellectual <i>tour de force</i> has always an
independent charm; and therefore it is well for
the cause of truth that the directness, sincerity,
and naturalness of things are beyond a certain
limit sacrificed in vain to a factitious interest.
A method so forced as that of Coleridge&#8217;s religious
philosophy is from the first doomed to be insipid,
so soon as the temporary interest or taste or
curiosity it was designed to meet has passed away.
Then, as to the manner of such books as the <i>Aids
to Reflection</i>, or <i>The Friend</i>:&mdash;These books came
from one whose vocation was in the world of
art; and yet, perhaps, of all books that have been
influential in modern times, they are farthest from
the classical form&mdash;bundles of notes&mdash;the original
matter inseparably mixed up with that borrowed
from others&mdash;the whole, just that mere preparation
for an artistic effect which the finished artist would
be careful one day to destroy. Here, again, we
have a trait profoundly characteristic of Coleridge.
He often attempts to reduce a phase of thought,
subtle and exquisite, to conditions too rough for it.
He uses a purely speculative gift in direct moral
edification. Scientific truth is something fugitive,
relative, full of fine gradations; he tries to fix it in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
absolute formulas. The <i>Aids to Reflection</i>, or <i>The
Friend</i>, is an effort to propagate the volatile spirit
of conversation into the less ethereal fabric of
a written book; and it is only here and there that
the poorer matter becomes vibrant, is really lifted
by the spirit.</p>

<p>At forty-two, we find Coleridge saying in a
letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I feel with an intensity unfathomable by words my utter
nothingness, impotence, and worthlessness in and for
myself. I have learned what a sin is against an infinite,
imperishable being such as is the soul of man. The consolations,
at least the sensible sweetness of hope, I do not
possess. On the contrary, the temptation which I have
constantly to fight up against is a fear that, if annihilation
and the possibility of heaven were offered to my choice,
I should choose the former.</p></div>

<p>What was the cause of this change? That is
precisely the point on which, after all the gossip
there has been, we are still ignorant. At times
Coleridge&#8217;s opium excesses were great; but what
led to those excesses must not be left out of account.
From boyhood he had a tendency to low fever,
betrayed by his constant appetite for bathing and
swimming, which he indulged even when a physician
had opposed it. In 1803, he went to Malta
as secretary to the English Governor. His daughter
suspects that the source of the evil was there, that
for one of his constitution the climate of Malta
was deadly. At all events, when he returned, the
charm of those five wonderful years had failed at
the source.</p>

<p>De Quincey said of him, &#8216;he wanted better
bread than can be made with wheat.&#8217; Lamb said
of him that from boyhood he had &#8216;hungered for
eternity&#8217;. Henceforth those are the two notes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
his life. From this time we must look for no more
true literary talent in him. His style becomes
greyer and greyer, his thoughts <i>outr&eacute;</i>, exaggerated,
a kind of credulity or superstition exercised upon
abstract words. Like Clifford, in Hawthorne&#8217;s
beautiful romance&mdash;the born Epicurean, who by
some strange wrong has passed the best of his days
in a prison&mdash;he is the victim of a division of the
will, often showing itself in trivial things: he
could never choose on which side of the garden path
he would walk. In 1803, he wrote a poem on
&#8216;The Pains of Sleep&#8217;. That unrest increased.
Mr. Gillman tells us &#8216;he had long been greatly
afflicted with nightmare, and when residing with
us was frequently aroused from this painful sleep
by any one of the family who might hear him&#8217;.</p>

<p>That faintness and continual dissolution had its
own consumptive refinements, and even brought,
as to the &#8216;Beautiful Soul&#8217; in <i>Wilhelm Meister</i>,
a faint religious ecstasy&mdash;that &#8216;singing in the sails&#8217;
which is not of the breeze. Here, again, is a note
of Coleridge&#8217;s:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8216;In looking at objects of nature while I am thinking, as
at yonder moon, dim-glimmering through the window-pane,
I seem rather to be seeking, as it were asking, a symbolical
language for something within me that already and for ever
exists, than observing anything new. Even when that
latter is the case, yet still I have always an obscure feeling,
as if that new phenomenon were the dim awaking of a forgotten
or hidden truth of my inner nature.&#8217; Then, &#8216;while
I was preparing the pen to write this remark, I lost the
train of thought which had led me to it.&#8217;</p></div>

<p>What a distemper of the eye of the mind!
What an almost bodily distemper there is in that!</p>

<p>Coleridge&#8217;s intellectual sorrows were many;
but he had one singular intellectual happiness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
With an inborn taste for transcendental philosophy
he lived just at the time when that philosophy took
an immense spring in Germany, and connected
itself with a brilliant literary movement. He had
the luck to light upon it in its freshness, and introduce
it to his countrymen. What an opportunity
for one reared on the colourless English philosophies,
but who feels an irresistible attraction
towards metaphysical synthesis! How rare are
such occasions of intellectual contentment! This
transcendental philosophy, chiefly as systematized
by Schelling, Coleridge applies, with an eager, unwearied
subtlety, to the questions of theology and
art-criticism. It is in his theory of art-criticism
that he comes nearest to true and important
principles; that is the least fugitive part of his
work. Let us take this first; here we shall most
clearly apprehend his main principle.</p>

<p>What, then, is the essence of this criticism? On
the whole it may be described as an attempt to
reclaim the world of art as a world of fixed laws&mdash;to
show that the creative activity of genius and the
simplest act of thought are but higher and lower
products of the laws of a universal logic. Criticism,
feeling its own unsuccess in dealing with the
greater works of art, has sometimes made too
much of those dark and capricious suggestions of
genius which even the intellect possessed by them
is unable to track or recall. It has seemed due to
their half-sacred character to look for no link
between the process by which they were produced
and the slighter processes of the mind. Coleridge
assumes that the highest phases of thought must be
more, not less, than the lower, subjects of law.</p>

<p>With this interest, in the <i>Biographia Literaria</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
he refines Schelling&#8217;s &#8216;Philosophy of Nature&#8217; into
a theory of art. &#8216;Es giebt kein Plagiat in der
Philosophie&#8217; says Heine, alluding to the charge
brought against Schelling of unacknowledged
borrowing from Bruno, and certainly that which
is common to Coleridge and Schelling is of far
earlier origin than the Renaissance. Schellingism,
the &#8216;Philosophy of Nature&#8217;, is indeed a constant
tradition in the history of thought; it embodies
a permanent type of the speculative temper.
That mode of conceiving nature as a mirror or
reflex of the intelligence of man may be traced
up to the first beginnings of Greek speculation.
There are two ways of envisaging those aspects
of nature which appear to bear the impress of
reason or intelligence. There is the deist&#8217;s way,
which regards them merely as marks of design,
which separates the informing mind from nature,
as the mechanist from the machine; and there is
the pantheistic way, which identifies the two,
which regards nature itself as the living energy of
an intelligence of the same kind as, but vaster
than, the human. Greek philosophy, finding indications
of mind everywhere, dwelling exclusively
in its observations on that which is general or
formal, on that which modern criticism regards as
the modification of things by the mind of the
observer, adopts the latter, or pantheistic way,
through the influence of the previous mythological
period. Mythology begins in the early necessities
of language, of which it is a kind of accident. But
at a later period its essence changes; it becomes
what it was not at its birth, the servant of a genuine
poetic interest, a kind of <i>vivification</i> of nature.
Played upon by those accidents of language, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
Greek mind becomes possessed by the conception
of nature as living, thinking, almost speaking to the
mind of man. This unfixed poetical prepossession,
reduced to an abstract form, petrified into an idea,
is the conception which gives a unity of aim to
Greek philosophy. Step by step it works out the
substance of the Hegelian formula: &#8216;Was ist, das
ist vern&uuml;nftig; was vern&uuml;nftig ist, das ist&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;Whatever
is, is according to reason; whatever is
according to reason, that is.&#8217; A science of which
that could be the formula is still but an intellectual
aspiration; the formula of true science is different.
Experience, which has gradually saddened the
earth&#8217;s colour, stiffened its motions, withdrawn
from it some blithe and debonair presence, has
moderated our demands upon science. The positive
method makes very little account of marks of intelligence
in nature; in its wider view of phenomena
it sees that those incidents are a minority,
and may rank as happy coincidences; it absorbs
them in the simpler conception of law. But the
suspicion of a mind latent in nature, struggling for
release and intercourse with the intellect of man
through true ideas, has never ceased to haunt a certain
class of minds. Started again and again in
successive periods by enthusiasts on the antique
pattern, in each case the thought has seemed paler
and more evanescent amidst the growing consistency
and sharpness of outline of other and more
positive forms of knowledge. Still, wherever
a speculative instinct has been united with extreme
inwardness of temperament, as in Jakob B&ouml;hme,
there the old Greek conception, like some seed
floating in the air, has taken root and sprung up
anew. Coleridge, thrust inward upon himself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
driven from &#8216;life in thought and sensation&#8217; to life
in thought only, feels in that dark London school
a thread of the Greek mind vibrating strangely
in him. At fifteen he is discoursing on Plotinus,
and has translated the hymns of Synesius. So in
later years he reflects from Schelling the flitting
tradition. He conceives a subtle co-ordination
between the ideas of the mind and the laws of the
natural world. Science is to be attained, not by
observation, analysis, generalization, but by the
evolution or recovery of those ideas from within,
by a sort of &#7936;&#957;&#8049;&#956;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;, every group of observed
facts remaining an enigma until the appropriate
idea is struck upon them from the mind of Newton
or Cuvier, the genius in whom sympathy with the
universal reason is entire. Next he supposes that
this reason or intelligence in nature gradually
becomes reflective&mdash;self-conscious. He fancies he
can track through all the simpler orders of life
fragments of an eloquent prophecy about the
human mind. He regards the whole of nature as
a development of higher forms out of the lower,
through shade after shade of systematic change.
The dim stir of chemical atoms towards the axes
of a crystal form, the trance-like life of plants, the
animal troubled by strange irritabilities, are stages
which anticipate consciousness. All through that
increasing stir of life this was forming itself; each
stage in its unsatisfied susceptibilities seeming to
be drawn out of its own limits by the more pronounced
current of life on its confines, the &#8216;shadow
of approaching humanity&#8217; gradually deepening,
the latent intelligence working to the surface.
At this point the law of development does not
lose itself in caprice; rather it becomes more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
constraining and incisive. From the lowest to the
highest acts of intelligence, there is another range of
refining shades. Gradually the mind concentrates
itself, frees itself from the limits of the particular,
the individual, attains a strange power of modifying
and centralizing what it receives from without
according to an inward ideal. At last, in imaginative
genius, ideas become effective; the intelligence
of nature, with all its elements connected and
justified, is clearly reflected; and the interpretation
of its latent purposes is fixed in works of art.</p>

<p>In this fanciful and bizarre attempt to rationalize
art, to range it under the dominion of law, there is
still a gap to be filled up. What is that common
law of the mind, of which a work of art and the
slighter acts of thought are alike products? Here
Coleridge weaves in Kant&#8217;s fine-spun theory of the
transformation of sense into perception. What
every theory of perception has to explain is that
associative power which gathers isolated sensible
qualities into the objects of the world about us.
Sense, without an associative power, would be
only a threadlike stream of colours, sounds, odours&mdash;each
struck upon one for a moment, and then
withdrawn. The basis of this association may be
represented as a material one, a kind of many-coloured
&#8216;etching&#8217; on the brain. Hartley has
dexterously handled this hypothesis. The charm
of his &#8216;theory of vibrations&#8217; is the vivid image
it presents to the fancy. How large an element
in a speculative talent is the command of these
happy images! Coleridge, by a finer effort of the
same kind, a greater delicacy of fancy, detects all
sorts of slips, transitions, breaks of continuity in
Hartley&#8217;s glancing cobweb. Coleridge, with Kant,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
regards all association as effected by a power
within, to which he gives a fanciful Greek name.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
In an act of perception there is the matter which
sense presents, colour, tone, feeling; but also
a form or mould, such as space, unity, causation,
suggested from within. In these forms we arrest
and frame the many attributes of sense. It is like
that simple chemical phenomenon where two
colourless fluids uniting reflect a full colour.
Neither matter nor form can be perceived asunder;
they unite into the many-coloured image of life.
This theory has not been able to bear a loyal
induction. Even if it were true, how little it would
tell us; how it attenuates fact! There, again,
the charm is all in the clear image; the image of the
artist combining a few elementary colours, curves,
sounds into a new whole. Well, this power of
association, of concentrating many elements of
sense in an object of perception, is refined and
deepened into the creative acts of imagination.</p>

<p>We of the modern ages have become so familiarized
with the greater works of art that we are little
sensitive of the act of creation in them; they do
not impress us as a new presence in the world.
Only sometimes in productions which realize immediately
a profound emotion and enforce a change
in taste, such as <i>Werther</i> or <i>Emile</i>, we are actual
witnesses of the moulding of an unforeseen type by
some new principle of association. By imagination,
the distinction between which and fancy is so
thrust upon his readers, Coleridge means a vigorous
act of association, which, by simplifying and restraining
their natural expression to an artificial
order, refines and perfects the types of human
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>passion. It represents the excitements of the
human kind, but reflected in a new manner,
&#8216;excitement itself imitating order.&#8217; &#8216;Originally
the offspring of passion,&#8217; he somewhere says, &#8216;but
now the adopted children of power.&#8217; So far there
is nothing new or distinctive; every one who can
receive from a poem or picture a total impression
will admit so much. What makes the view distinctive
in Coleridge are the Schellingistic associations
with which he colours it, that faint glamour
of the philosophy of nature which was ever influencing
his thoughts. That suggested the idea
of a subtly winding parallel, a &#8216;rapport&#8217; in every
detail, between the human mind and the world
without it, laws of nature being so many transformed
ideas. Conversely, the ideas of the human
mind would be only transformed laws. Genius
would be in a literal sense an exquisitely purged
sympathy with nature. Those associative conceptions
of the imagination, those unforeseen types
of passion, would come, not so much of the artifice
and invention of the understanding, as from self-surrender
to the suggestions of nature; they
would be evolved by the stir of nature itself
realizing the highest reach of its latent intelligence;
they would have a kind of antecedent necessity to
rise at some time to the surface of the human
mind.</p>

<p>It is natural that Shakespeare should be the
idol of all such criticism, whether in England or
Germany. The first effect in Shakespeare is that of
capricious detail, of the waywardness that plays
with the parts careless of the impression of the
whole. But beyond there is the constraining unity
of effect, the uneffaceable impression, of <i>Hamlet</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
or <i>Macbeth</i>. His hand moving freely is curved
round by some law of gravitation from within;
that is, there is the most constraining unity in
the most abundant variety. Coleridge exaggerates
this unity into something like the unity of a natural
organism, the associative act that effected it into
something closely akin to the primitive power of
nature itself. &#8216;In the Shakespearian drama&#8217;, he
says, &#8216;there is a vitality which grows and evolves
itself from within.&#8217; Again:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He, too, worked in the spirit of nature, by evolving the
germ from within by the imaginative power according to
the idea. For as the power of seeing is to light, so is an
idea in mind to a law in nature. They are correlatives
which suppose each other.</p></div>

<p>Again:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The organic form is innate; it shapes, as it develops,
itself from within, and the fulness of its development is one
and the same with the perfection of its outward form.
Such as the life is, such is the form. Nature, the prime
genial artist, inexhaustible in diverse powers, is equally
inexhaustible in forms; each exterior is the physiognomy
of the being within, and even such is the appropriate excellence
of Shakespeare, himself a nature humanized, a genial
understanding, directing self-consciously a power and an
implicit wisdom deeper even than our consciousness.</p></div>

<p>There &#8216;the absolute&#8217; has been affirmed in the
sphere of art; and thought begins to congeal.
Coleridge has not only overstrained the elasticity
of his hypothesis, but has also obscured the true
interest of art. For, after all, the artist has become
something almost mechanical; instead of being
the most luminous and self-possessed phase of
consciousness, the associative act itself looks like
some organic process of assimilation. The work of
art is sometimes likened to the living organism.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
That expresses the impression of a self-delighting,
independent life which a finished work of art gives
us; it does not express the process by which that
work was produced. Here there is no blind ferment
of lifeless elements to realize a type. By
exquisite analysis the artist attains clearness of
idea, then, by many stages of refining, clearness of
expression. He moves slowly over his work,
calculating the tenderest tone, and restraining the
subtlest curve, never letting his hand or fancy
move at large, gradually refining flaccid spaces
to the higher degree of expressiveness. Culture,
at least, values even in transcendent works of art
the power of the understanding in them, their
logical process of construction, the spectacle of
supreme intellectual dexterity which they afford.</p>

<p>Coleridge&#8217;s criticism may well be remembered as
part of the long pleading of German culture for the
things &#8216;behind the veil&#8217;. It recalls us from the
work of art to the mind of the artist; and, after
all, this is what is infinitely precious, and the work
of art only as the index of it. Still, that is only
the narrower side of a complete criticism. Perhaps
it is true, as some one says in Lessing&#8217;s <i>Emilie
Galotti</i>, that, if Michael Angelo had been born
without hands, he would still have been the greatest
of artists. But we must admit the truth also of
an opposite view: &#8216;In morals as in art&#8217;, says
M. Renan, &#8216;the word is nothing&mdash;the fact is everything.
The idea which lurks under a picture of
Raphael is a slight matter; it is the picture itself
only that counts.&#8217;</p>

<p>What constitutes an artistic gift is, first of all,
a natural susceptibility to moments of strange
excitement, in which the colours freshen upon our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
thread bare world, and the routine of things about
us is broken by a novel and happier synthesis.
These are moments into which other minds may be
made to enter, but which they cannot originate.
This susceptibility is the element of genius in an
artistic gift. Secondly, there is what may be
called the talent of projection, of throwing these
happy moments into an external concrete form&mdash;a
statue, or play, or picture. That projection is
of all degrees of completeness; its facility and
transparence are modified by the circumstances of
the individual, his culture, and his age. When it is
perfectly transparent, the work is classical. Compare
the power of projection in Mr. Browning&#8217;s
<i>Sordello</i>, with that power in the <i>Sorrows of
Werther</i>. These two elements determine the two
chief aims of criticism. First, it has to classify
those initiative moments according to the amount
of interest excited in them, to estimate their comparative
acceptability, their comparative power of
giving joy to those who undergo them. Secondly,
it has to test, by a study of the artistic product
itself, in connexion with the intellectual and
spiritual condition of its age, the completeness of
the projection. These two aims form the positive,
or concrete, side of criticism; their direction is not
towards a metaphysical definition of the universal
element in an artistic effort, but towards a subtle
gradation of the shades of difference between one
artistic gift and another. This side of criticism
is infinitely varied; and it is what French culture
more often achieves than the German.</p>

<p>Coleridge has not achieved this side in an equal
degree with the other; and this want is not supplied
by the <i>Literary Remains</i>, which contain his studies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
on Shakespeare. There we have a repetition, not
an application, of the absolute formula. Coleridge
is like one who sees in a picture only the rules of
perspective, and is always trying to simplify even
those. Thus: &#8216;Where there is no humour, but
only wit, or the like, there is no growth from within.&#8217;
&#8216;What is beauty&#8217;? he asks. &#8216;It is the unity of
the manifold, the coalescence of the diverse.&#8217; So
of Dante: &#8216;There is a total impression of infinity;
the wholeness is not in vision or conception, but in
an inner feeling of totality and absolute being.&#8217;
Again, of the <i>Paradise Lost</i>: &#8216;It has the totality
of the poem as distinguished from the <i>ab ovo</i> birth
and parentage or straight line of history.&#8217;</p>

<p>That exaggerated inwardness is barren. Here,
too, Coleridge&#8217;s thoughts require to be thawed, to
be set in motion. He is admirable in the detection,
the analysis, and statement of a few of the highest
general laws of art-production. But he withdraws
us too far from what we can see, hear, and
feel. Doubtless, the idea, the intellectual element,
is the spirit and life of art. Still, art is the triumph
of the senses and the emotions; and the senses and
the emotions must not be cheated of their triumph
after all. That strange and beautiful psychology
which he employs, with its evanescent delicacies,
has not sufficient corporeity. Again, one feels that
the discussion about Hartley, meeting us in the way,
throws a tone of insecurity over the critical theory
which it introduces. Its only effect is to win for
the terms in which that criticism is expressed, the
associations of one side in a metaphysical controversy.</p>

<p>The vagueness and fluidity of Coleridge&#8217;s theological
opinions have been exaggerated through an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
illusion, which has arisen from the occasional form
in which they have reached us. Criticism, then,
has to methodize and focus them. They may be
arranged under three heads; the general principles
of supernaturalism, orthodox dogmas, the interpretation
of Scripture. With regard to the first
and second, Coleridge ranks as a Conservative
thinker; but his principles of Scriptural interpretation
resemble Lessing&#8217;s; they entitle him to be
regarded as the founder of the modern liberal
school of English theology. By supernaturalism
is meant the theory of a divine person in immediate
communication with the human mind, dealing
with it out of that order of nature which includes
man&#8217;s body and his ordinary trains of thought,
according to fixed laws, which the theologian sums
up in the doctrines of &#8216;grace&#8217; and &#8216;sin&#8217;. Of this
supernaturalism, the <i>Aids to Reflection</i> attempts
to give a metaphysical proof. The first necessity
of the argument is to prove that religion, with its
supposed experiences of grace and sin, and the
realities of a world above the world of sense, is the
fulfilment of the constitution of every man, or,
in the language of the &#8216;philosophy of nature&#8217;, is
part of the &#8216;idea&#8217; of man; so that, when those
experiences are absent, all the rest of his nature
is unexplained, like some enigmatical fragment,
the construction and working of which we cannot
surmise. According to Schelling&#8217;s principle,
the explanation of every phase of life is to be
sought in that next above it. This axiom is
applied to three supposed stages of man&#8217;s reflective
life: Prudence, Morality, Religion. Prudence, by
which Coleridge means something like Bentham&#8217;s
&#8216;enlightened principle of self-preservation&#8217;, is, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
says, an inexplicable instinct, a blind motion in the
dark, until it is expanded into morality. Morality,
again, is but a groundless prepossession until transformed
into a religious recognition of a spiritual
world, until, as Coleridge says in his rich figurative
language, &#8216;like the main feeder into some majestic
lake, rich with hidden springs of its own, it flows
into, and becomes one with, the spiritual life.&#8217; A
spiritual life, then, being the fulfilment of human
nature, implied, if we see clearly, in those instincts
which enable one to live on from day to day, is
part of the &#8216;idea&#8217; of man.</p>

<p>The second necessity of the argument is to prove
that &#8216;the idea&#8217;, according to the principle of the
&#8216;philosophy of nature&#8217;, is an infallible index of the
actual condition of the world without us. Here
Coleridge introduces an analogy:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the world, we see everywhere evidences of a unity,
which the component parts are so far from explaining, that
they necessarily presuppose it as the cause and condition
of their existing as those parts, or even of their existing at
all. This antecedent unity, or cause and principle of each
union, it has, since the time of Bacon and Kepler, been
customary to call a law. This crocus for instance; or any
other flower the reader may have before his sight, or choose
to bring before his fancy; that the root, stem, leaves, petals,
&amp;c., cohere to one plant is owing to an antecedent power or
principle in the seed which existed before a single particle
of the matters that constitute the size and visibility of the
crocus had been attracted from the surrounding soil, air,
and moisture. Shall we turn to the seed? there, too, the
same necessity meets us: an antecedent unity must here,
too, be supposed. Analyse the seeds with the finest tools,
and let the solar microscope come in aid of your senses,
what do you find?&mdash;means and instruments; a wondrous
fairy tale of nature, magazines of food, stores of various
sorts, pipes, spiracles, defences; a house of many chambers,
and the owner and inhabitant invisible.</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Aids to Reflection.</i></p></div>

<p>Nature, that is, works by what we may call<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
&#8216;intact ideas&#8217;. It co-ordinates every part of the
crocus to all the other parts; one stage of its
growth to the whole process; and having framed
its organism to assimilate certain external elements,
it does not cheat it of those elements, soil, air,
moisture. Well, if the &#8216;idea&#8217; of man is to be
intact, he must be enveloped in a supernatural
world; and nature always works by intact ideas.
The spiritual life is the highest development of the
idea of man; there must be a supernatural world
corresponding to it.</p>

<p>One finds, it is hard to say how many, difficulties
in drawing Coleridge&#8217;s conclusion. To mention
only one of them&mdash;the argument looks too like the
exploded doctrine of final causes. Of course the
crocus would not live unless the conditions of its
life were supplied. The flower is made for soil, air,
moisture, and it has them; just as man&#8217;s senses
are made for a sensible world, and we have the
sensible world. But give the flower the power of
dreaming, nourish it on its own reveries, put man&#8217;s
wild hunger of heart and susceptibility to <i>ennui</i> in
it, and what indication of the laws of the world
without it, would be afforded by its longing to
break its bonds?</p>

<p>In theology people are content with analogies,
probabilities, with the empty schemes of arguments
for which the data are still lacking; arguments, the
rejection of which Coleridge tells us implies &#8216;an
evil heart of unbelief&#8217;, but of which we might as
truly say that they derive all their consistency
from the peculiar atmosphere of the mind which
receives them. Such arguments are received in
theology because what chains men to a religion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
is not its claim on their reason, their hopes or fears,
but the glow it affords to the world, its &#8216;beau
ideal&#8217;. Coleridge thinks that if we reject the
supernatural, the spiritual element in life will
evaporate also, that we shall have to accept a life
with narrow horizons, without disinterestedness,
harshly cut off from the springs of life in the past.
But what is this spiritual element? It is the
passion for inward perfection, with its sorrows, its
aspirations, its joy. These mental states are the
delicacies of the higher morality of the few, of
Augustine, of the author of the &#8216;Imitation&#8217;, of
Francis de Sales; in their essence they are only
the permanent characteristics of the higher life.
Augustine, or the author of the &#8216;Imitation&#8217;,
agreeably to the culture of their age, had expressed
them in the terms of a metaphysical theory, and
expanded them into what theologians call the
doctrines of grace and sin, the fluctuations of the
union of the soul with its unseen friend. The life
of those who are capable of a passion for perfection
still produces the same mental states; but that
religious expression of them is no longer congruous
with the culture of the age. Still, all inward life
works itself out in a few simple forms, and culture
cannot go very far before the religious graces reappear
in it in a subtilized intellectual shape.
There are aspects of the religious character which
have an artistic worth distinct from their religious
import. Longing, a chastened temper, spiritual
joy, are precious states of mind, not because they
are part of man&#8217;s duty or because God has commanded
them, still less because they are means of
obtaining a reward, but because like culture itself
they are remote, refined, intense, existing only by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
the triumph of a few over a dead world of routine
in which there is no lifting of the soul at all. If
there is no other world, art in its own interest must
cherish such characteristics as beautiful spectacles.
Stephen&#8217;s face, &#8216;like the face of an angel,&#8217; has
a worth of its own, even if the opened heaven is but
a dream.</p>

<p>Our culture, then, is not supreme, our intellectual
life is incomplete, we fail of the intellectual throne,
if we have no inward longing, inward chastening,
inward joy. Religious belief, the craving for objects
of belief, may be refined out of our hearts, but they
must leave their sacred perfume, their spiritual sweetness
behind. This law of the highest intellectual life
has sometimes seemed hard to understand. Those
who maintain the claims of the older and narrower
forms of religious life against the claims of culture
are often embarrassed at finding the intellectual
life heated through with the very graces to which
they would sacrifice it. How often in the higher
class of theological writings&mdash;writings which really
spring from an original religious genius, such as
those of Dr. Newman&mdash;does the modern aspirant
to perfect culture seem to find the expression of the
inmost delicacies of his own life, the same yet
different! The spiritualities of the Christian life
have often drawn men on, little by little, into the
broader spiritualities of systems opposed to it&mdash;pantheism,
or positivism, or a philosophy of indifference.
Many in our own generation, through religion,
have become dead to religion. How often do we
have to look for some feature of the ancient religious
life, not in a modern saint, but in a modern
artist or philosopher! For those who have passed
out of Christianity, perhaps its most precious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
souvenir is the ideal of a transcendental disinterestedness.
Where shall we look for this ideal?
In Spinoza; or perhaps in Bentham or in Austin.</p>

<p>Some of those who have wished to save supernaturalism&mdash;as,
for instance, Theodore Parker&mdash;have
rejected more or less entirely the dogmas of
the Church. Coleridge&#8217;s instinct is truer than
theirs; the two classes of principles are logically
connected. It was in defence of the dogmas of
the Church that Coleridge elaborated his unhappy
crotchet of the diversity of the reason from the
understanding. The weakness of these dogmas
had ever been, not so much a failure of the authority
of Scripture or tradition in their favour, as their
conflict with the reason that they were words
rather than conceptions. That analysis of words
and conceptions which in modern philosophy has
been a principle of continual rejuvenescence with
Descartes and Berkeley, as well as with Bacon and
Locke, had desolated the field of scholastic theology.
It is the rationality of the dogmas of that theology
that Coleridge had a taste for proving.</p>

<p>Of course they conflicted with the understanding,
with the common daylight of the mind, but then
might there not be some mental faculty higher than
the understanding? The history of philosophy
supplied many authorities for this opinion. Then,
according to the &#8216;philosophy of nature&#8217;, science
and art are both grounded upon the &#8216;ideas&#8217; of
genius, which are a kind of intuition, which are
their own evidence. Again, this philosophy was
always saying the ideas of the mind must be true,
must correspond to reality; and what an aid to
faith is that, if one is not too nice in distinguishing
between ideas and mere convictions, or prejudices,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
or habitual views, or safe opinions! Kant also
had made a distinction between the reason and the
understanding. True, this harsh division of mental
faculties is exactly what is most sterile in Kant, the
essential tendency of the German school of thought
being to show that the mind always acts <i>en masse</i>.
Kant had defined two senses of reason as opposed
to the understanding. First, there was the
&#8216;speculative reason&#8217;, with its &#8216;three categories of
totality&#8217;, God, the soul, and the universe&mdash;three
mental forms which might give a sort of unity to
science, but to which no actual intuition corresponded.
The tendency of this part of Kant&#8217;s
critique is to destroy the rational groundwork of
theism. Then there was the &#8216;practical reason&#8217;,
on the relation of which to the &#8216;speculative&#8217;, we may
listen to Heinrich Heine:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8216;After the tragedy comes the farce. [The tragedy is
Kant&#8217;s destructive criticism of the speculative reason.]
So far Immanuel Kant has been playing the relentless
philosopher; he has laid siege to heaven.&#8217; Heine goes on
with some violence to describe the havoc Kant has made
of the orthodox belief: &#8216;Old Lampe,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> with the umbrella
under his arm, stands looking on much disturbed, perspiration
and tears of sorrow running down his cheeks. Then
Immanuel Kant grows pitiful, and shows that he is not only
a great philosopher but also a good man. He considers
a little; and then, half in good nature, half in irony, he says,
&#8220;Old Lampe must have a god, otherwise the poor man will
not be happy; but man ought to be happy in this life,
the practical reason says that; let the practical reason
stand surety for the existence of a god; it is all the same
to me.&#8221; Following this argument, Kant distinguishes
between the theoretical and the practical reason, and, with
the practical reason for a magic wand, he brings to life the
dead body of deism, which the theoretical reason had
slain.&#8217;</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span></p>
<p>Coleridge first confused the speculative reason
with the practical, and then exaggerated the variety
and the sphere of their combined functions. Then
he has given no consistent definition of the reason.
It is &#8216;the power of universal and necessary convictions&#8217;;
it is &#8216;the knowledge of the laws of
the whole considered as one&#8217;; it is &#8216;the science of
all as a whole&#8217;. Again, the understanding is &#8216;the
faculty judging according to sense&#8217;, or &#8216;the
faculty of means to mediate ends&#8217;; and so on.
The conception floating in his mind seems to have
been a really valuable one; that, namely, of a distinction
between an organ of adequate and an
organ of inadequate ideas. But when we find him
casting about for a definition, not precisely determining
the functions of the reason, making long
preparations for the &#8216;deduction&#8217; of the faculty, as
in the third column of <i>The Friend</i>, but never
actually starting, we suspect that the reason is
a discovery in psychology which Coleridge has
a good will to make, and that is all; that he has
got no farther than the old vague desire to escape
from the limitations of thought by some extraordinary
mystical faculty. Some of the clergy
eagerly welcomed the supposed discovery. In
their difficulties they had often appealed in the old
simple way to sentiment and emotion as of higher
authority than the understanding, and on the
whole had had to get on with very little philosophy.
Like M. Jourdain, they were amazed to find that
they had been all the time appealing to the reason;
now they might actually go out to meet the enemy.
Orthodoxy might be cured by a hair of the dog that
had bitten it.</p>

<p>Theology is a great house, scored all over with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
hieroglyphics by perished hands. When we
decipher one of these hieroglyphics, we find in it
the statement of a mistaken opinion; but knowledge
has crept onward since the hand dropped
from the wall; we no longer entertain the opinion,
and we can trace the origin of the mistake. Dogmas
are precious as memorials of a class of sincere
and beautiful spirits, who in a past age of humanity
struggled with many tears, if not for true knowledge,
yet for a noble and elevated happiness.
That struggle is the substance, the dogma only its
shadowy expression; received traditionally in an
altered age, it is the shadow of a shadow, a mere
&#964;&#961;&#8055;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#949;&#7988;&#948;&#969;&#955;&#959;&#957;, twice removed from substance
and reality. The true method then in the treatment
of dogmatic theology must be historical.
Englishmen are gradually finding out how much
that method has done since the beginning of modern
criticism by the hands of such writers as Baur.
Coleridge had many of the elements of this method:
learning, inwardness, a subtle psychology, a dramatic
power of sympathy with modes of thought
other than his own. Often in carrying out his own
method he gives the true historical origin of a
dogma, but, with a strange dullness of the historical
sense, he regards this as a reason for the existence
of the dogma now, not merely as reason for its
having existed in the past. Those historical
elements he could not envisage in the historical
method, because this method is only one of the
applications, the most fruitful of them all, of the
relative spirit.</p>

<p>After Coleridge&#8217;s death, seven letters of his on
the inspiration of Scripture were published, under
the title of <i>Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
This little book has done more than any other of
Coleridge&#8217;s writings to discredit his name with the
orthodox. The frequent occurrence in it of the
word &#8216;bibliolatry&#8217;, borrowed from Lessing, would
sufficiently account for this pious hatred. From
bibliolatry Coleridge was saved by the spiritualism,
which, in questions less simple than that of the
infallibility of Scripture, was so retarding to his
culture. Bibliolators may remember that one
who committed a kind of intellectual suicide by
catching at any appearance of a fixed and absolute
authority, never dreamed of resting on the authority
of a book. His Schellingistic notion of the possibility
of absolute knowledge, of knowing God, of
a light within every man which might discover
to him the doctrines of Christianity, tended to
depreciate historical testimony, perhaps historical
realism altogether. Scripture is a legitimate sphere
for the understanding. He says, indeed, that there
is more in the Bible that &#8216;finds&#8217; him than he has
experienced in all other books put together. But
still, &#8216;There is a Light higher than all, even the
Word that was in the beginning. If between this
Word and the written letter I shall anywhere seem
to myself to find a discrepance, I will not conclude
that such there actually is; nor on the other hand
will I fall under the condemnation of them that
would lie for God, but seek as I may, be thankful
for what I have&mdash;and wait.&#8217; Coleridge is the
inaugurator of that <i>via media</i> of Scriptural criticism
which makes much of saving the word &#8216;inspiration&#8217;,
while it attenuates its meaning; which supposes
a sort of modified inspiration residing in the whole,
not in the several parts. &#8216;The Scriptures were
not dictated by an infallible intelligence;&#8217; nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
&#8216;the writers each and all divinely informed as well
as inspired&#8217;. &#8216;They refer to other documents, and
in all points express themselves as sober-minded
and veracious writers under ordinary circumstances
are known to do.&#8217; To make the Bible itself &#8216;the
subject of a special article of faith, is an unnecessary
and useless abstraction&#8217;.</p>

<p>His judgement on the popular view of inspiration
is severe. It is borrowed from the Cabbalists;
it &#8216;petrifies at once the whole body of Holy Writ,
with all its harmonies and symmetrical gradations;&mdash;turns
it at once into a colossal Memnon&#8217;s head,
a hollow passage for a voice, a voice that mocks
the voices of many men, and speaks in their
names, and yet is but one voice and the same;&mdash;and
no man uttered it and never in a human heart
was it conceived&#8217;. He presses very hard on the
tricks of the &#8216;routiniers of desk and pulpit&#8217;;
forced and fantastic interpretations; &#8216;the strange&mdash;in
all other writings unexampled&mdash;practice of
bringing together into logical dependency detached
sentences from books composed at the distance of
centuries, nay, sometimes a millennium, from each
other, under different dispensations, and for different
objects.&#8217;</p>

<p>Certainly he is much farther from bibliolatry
than from the perfect freedom of the humanist
interpreters. Still he has not freed himself from
the notion of a sacred canon; he cannot regard the
books of Scripture simply as fruits of the human
spirit; his criticism is not entirely disinterested.
The difficulties he finds are chiefly the supposed
immoralities of Scripture; just those difficulties
which fade away before the modern or relative
spirit, which in the moral world, as in the physical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
traces everywhere change, growth, development.
Of historical difficulties, of those deeper moral
difficulties which arise, for instance, from a consideration
of the constitutional unveracity of the
Oriental mind, he has no suspicion. He thinks
that no book of the New Testament was composed
so late as <small>A.D.</small> 120.</p>

<p>Coleridge&#8217;s undeveloped opinions would be
hardly worth stating except for the warning they
afford against retarding compromises. In reading
these letters one never doubts what Coleridge tells
us of himself: &#8216;that he loved truth with an indescribable
awe,&#8217; or, as he beautifully says, &#8216;that
he would creep towards the light, even if the light
had made its way through a rent in the wall of the
temple.&#8217; And yet there is something sad in reading
them by the light which twenty-five years have
thrown back upon them. Taken as a whole, they
contain a fallacy which a very ardent lover of truth
might have detected.</p>

<p>The Bible is not to judge the spirit, but the spirit
the Bible. The Bible is to be treated as a literary
product. Well, but that is a conditional, not an
absolute principle&mdash;that is not, if we regard it
sincerely, a delivery of judgement, but only a suspension
of it. If we are true to the spirit of that,
we must wait patiently the complete result of
modern criticism. Coleridge states that the
authority of Scripture is on its trial&mdash;that at
present it is not known to be an absolute resting-place;
and then, instead of leaving that to aid in
the formation of a fearless spirit, the spirit which,
for instance, would accept the results of M. Renan&#8217;s
investigations, he turns it into a false security by
anticipating the judgement of an undeveloped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
criticism. Twenty-five years of that criticism
have gone by, and have hardly verified the
anticipation.</p>

<p>The man of science asks, Are absolute principles
attainable? What are the limits of knowledge?
The answer he receives from science itself is not
ambiguous. What the moralist asks is, Shall we
gain or lose by surrendering human life to the
relative spirit? Experience answers, that the
dominant tendency of life is to turn ascertained
truth into a dead letter&mdash;to make us all the
phlegmatic servants of routine. The relative
spirit, by dwelling constantly on the more fugitive
conditions or circumstances of things, breaking
through a thousand rough and brutal classifications,
and giving elasticity to inflexible principles,
begets an intellectual finesse, of which the ethical
result is a delicate and tender justness in the criticism
of human life. Who would gain more than
Coleridge by criticism in such a spirit? We know
how his life has appeared when judged by absolute
standards. We see him trying to apprehend the
absolute, to stereotype one form of faith, to attain,
as he says, &#8216;fixed principles&#8217; in politics, morals,
and religion; to fix one mode of life as the essence
of life, refusing to see the parts as parts only; and
all the time his own pathetic history pleads for
a more elastic moral philosophy than his, and
cries out against every formula less living and
flexible than life itself.</p>

<p>&#8216;From his childhood he hungered for eternity.&#8217;
After all, that is the incontestable claim of Coleridge.
The perfect flower of any elementary type of life
must always be precious to humanity, and Coleridge
is the perfect flower of the romantic type. More<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
than Childe Harold, more than Werther, more
than Ren&eacute;, Coleridge, by what he did, what he was,
and what he failed to do, represents that inexhaustible
discontent, languor, and home-sickness,
the chords of which ring all through our modern
literature. Criticism may still discuss the claims
of classical and romantic art, or literature, or
sentiment; and perhaps one day we may come to
forget the horizon, with full knowledge to be content
with what is here and now; and that is the
essence of classical feeling. But by us of the
present moment, by us for whom the Greek spirit,
with its engaging naturalness, simple, chastened,
debonair,&#964;&#961;&#965;&#966;&#8134;&#962;, &#7937;&#946;&#961;&#8057;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962;, &#967;&#955;&#953;&#948;&#8134;&#962;, &#967;&#945;&#961;&#8055;&#964;&#969;&#957;, &#7985;&#956;&#8051;&#961;&#959;&#965; &#960;&#8057;&#952;&#959;&#965; &#960;&#945;&#964;&#8053;&#961;,
is itself the Sangraal of an endless
pilgrimage, Coleridge, with his passion for the
absolute, for something fixed where all is moving,
his faintness, his broken memory, his intellectual
disquiet, may still be ranked among the interpreters
of one of the constituent elements of our
life.</p>

<h3>1803-1882</h3>

<h3>SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Great</span> men are more distinguished by range and
extent than by originality. If we require the
originality which consists in weaving, like a spider,
their web from their own bowels; in finding clay,
and making bricks, and building the house; no
great men are original. Nor does valuable originality
consist in unlikeness to other men. The hero
is in the press of knights, and the thick of events;
and, seeing what men want, and sharing their
desire, he adds the needful length of sight and of
arm, to come at the desired point. The greatest
genius is the most indebted man. A poet is no
rattlebrain, saying what comes uppermost, and,
because he says everything, saying, at last, something
good; but a heart in unison with his time
and country. There is nothing whimsical and
fantastic in his production, but sweet and sad
earnest, freighted with the weightiest convictions,
and pointed with the most determined aim which
any man or class knows of in his times.</p>

<p>The Genius of our life is jealous of individuals,
and will not have any individual great, except
through the general. There is no choice to genius.
A great man does not wake up on some fine morning,
and say, &#8216;I am full of life, I will go to sea, and
find an Antarctic continent: to-day I will square<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
the circle: I will ransack botany, and find a new
food for man: I have a new architecture in my
mind: I foresee a new mechanic power:&#8217; no, but
he finds himself in the river of the thoughts and
events, forced onward by the ideas and necessities
of his contemporaries. He stands where all the
eyes of men look one way, and their hands all
point in the direction in which he should go. The
church has reared him amidst rites and pomps,
and he carries out the advice which her music gave
him, and builds a cathedral needed by her chants
and processions. He finds a war raging: it educates
him, by trumpet, in barracks, and he betters
the instruction. He finds two counties groping to
bring coal, or flour, or fish, from the place of production
to the place of consumption, and he hits
on a railroad. Every master has found his material
collected, and his power lay in his sympathy with
his people, and in his love of the materials he
wrought in. What an economy of power! and
what a compensation for the shortness of life!
All is done to his hand. The world has brought
him thus far on his way. The human race has
gone out before him, sunk the hills, filled the hollows,
and bridged the rivers. Men, nations, poets,
artisans, women, all have worked for him, and he
enters into their labours. Choose any other thing,
out of the line of tendency, out of the national
feeling and history, and he would have all to do
for himself; his powers would be expended in the
first preparations. Great genial power, one would
almost say, consists in not being original at all;
in being altogether receptive; in letting the world
do all, and suffering the spirit of the hour to pass
unobstructed through the mind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span></p>

<p>Shakespeare&#8217;s youth fell in a time when the
English people were importunate for dramatic
entertainments. The court took offence easily at
political allusions, and attempted to suppress
them. The Puritans, a growing and energetic
party, and the religious among the Anglican church,
would suppress them. But the people wanted them.
Inn-yards, houses without roofs, and extemporaneous
enclosures at country fairs, were the ready
theatres of strolling players. The people had
tasted this new joy; and, as we could not hope
to suppress newspapers now,&mdash;no, not by the
strongest party,&mdash;neither then could king, prelate,
or puritan, alone or united, suppress an organ,
which was ballad, epic, newspaper, caucus, lecture,
punch, and library, at the same time. Probably
king, prelate, and puritan, all found their own
account in it. It had become, by all causes, a
national interest,&mdash;by no means conspicuous, so
that some great scholar would have thought of
treating it in an English history,&mdash;but not a whit
less considerable, because it was cheap, and of no
account, like a baker&#8217;s shop. The best proof of its
vitality is the crowd of writers which suddenly
broke into this field: Kyd, Marlowe, Greene,
Jonson, Chapman, Dekker, Webster, Heywood,
Middleton, Peele, Ford, Massinger, Beaumont,
and Fletcher.</p>

<p>The secure possession, by the stage, of the public
mind, is of the first importance to the poet who
works for it. He loses no time in idle experiments.
Here is audience and expectation prepared. In
the case of Shakespeare, there is much more. At
the time when he left Stratford, and went up to
London, a great body of stage-plays, of all dates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
and writers, existed in manuscript, and were in
turn produced on the boards. Here is the Tale
of Troy, which the audience will bear hearing some
part of every week; the Death of Julius C&aelig;sar,
and other stories out of Plutarch, which they never
tire of; a shelf full of English history, from the
chronicles of Brut and Arthur, down to the royal
Henries, which men hear eagerly; and a string
of doleful tragedies, merry Italian tales, and Spanish
voyages, which all the London prentices know.
All the mass has been treated, with more or less
skill, by every playwright, and the prompter has
the soiled and tattered manuscripts. It is now
no longer possible to say who wrote them first.
They have been the property of the Theatre so
long, and so many rising geniuses have enlarged
or altered them, inserting a speech, or a whole
Scene, or adding a song, that no man can any
longer claim copyright in this work of numbers.
Happily, no man wishes to. They are not yet
desired in that way. We have few readers, many
spectators and hearers. They had best lie where
they are.</p>

<p>Shakespeare, in common with his comrades,
esteemed the mass of old plays, waste stock, in
which any experiment could be freely tried. Had
the <i>prestige</i> which hedges about a modern tragedy
existed, nothing could have been done. The rude
warm blood of the living England circulated in
the play, as in street-ballads, and gave body which
he wanted to his airy and majestic fancy. The
poet needs a ground in popular tradition on which
he may work, and which, again, may restrain his
art within the due temperance. It holds him to
the people, supplies a foundation for his edifice;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
and, in furnishing so much work done to his hand,
leaves him at leisure, and in full strength for the
audacities of his imagination. In short, the poet
owes to his legend what sculpture owed to the
temple. Sculpture in Egypt, and in Greece, grew
up in subordination to architecture. It was the
ornament of the temple wall: at first, a rude relief
carved on pediments, then the relief became bolder,
and a head or arm was projected from the wall,
the groups being still arranged with reference
to the building, which serves also as a frame to
hold the figures; and when, at last, the greatest
freedom of style and treatment was reached, the
prevailing genius of architecture still enforced a
certain calmness and continence in the statue.
As soon as the statue was begun for itself, and
with no reference to the temple or palace, the art
began to decline; freak, extravagance, and exhibition,
took the place of the old temperance. This
balance-wheel, which the sculptor found in architecture,
the perilous irritability of poetic talent
found in the accumulated dramatic materials to
which the people were already wonted, and which
had a certain excellence which no single genius,
however extraordinary, could hope to create.</p>

<p>In point of fact, it appears that Shakespeare did
owe debts in all directions, and was able to use
whatever he found; and the amount of indebtedness
may be inferred from Malone&#8217;s laborious computations
in regard to the First, Second, and Third
parts of <i>Henry VI</i>, in which, &#8216;out of 6043 lines,
1771 were written by some author preceding
Shakespeare; 2373 by him, on the foundation
laid by his predecessors; and 1899 were entirely
his own.&#8217; And the proceeding investigation hardly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
leaves a single drama of his absolute invention.
Malone&#8217;s sentence is an important piece of external
history. In <i>Henry VIII</i>, I think I see plainly the
cropping out of the original rock on which his own
finer stratum was laid. The first play was written
by a superior, thoughtful man, with a vicious ear.
I can mark his lines, and know well their cadence.
See Wolsey&#8217;s soliloquy, and the following scene
with Cromwell, where,&mdash;instead of the metre of
Shakespeare, whose secret is, that the thought
constructs the tune, so that reading for the sense
will best bring out the rhythm,&mdash;here the lines are
constructed on a given tune, and the verse has even
a trace of pulpit eloquence. But the play contains,
through all its length, unmistakable traits of
Shakespeare&#8217;s hand, and some passages, as the
account of the coronation, are like autographs.
What is odd, the compliment to Queen Elizabeth
is in the bad rhythm.</p>

<p>Shakespeare knew that tradition supplies a
better fable than any invention can. If he lost
any credit of design, he augmented his resources;
and, at that day, our petulant demand for originality
was not so much pressed. There was no
literature for the million. The universal reading,
the cheap press, were unknown. A great poet,
who appears in illiterate times, absorbs into his
sphere all the light which is anywhere radiating.
Every intellectual jewel, every flower of sentiment,
it is his fine office to bring to his people; and he
comes to value his memory equally with his invention.
He is therefore little solicitous whence his
thoughts have been derived; whether through
translation, whether through tradition, whether
by travel in distant countries, whether by inspiration;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
from whatever source, they are equally
welcome to his uncritical audience. Nay, he
borrows very near home. Other men say wise
things as well as he; only they say a good many
foolish things, and do not know when they have
spoken wisely. He knows the sparkle of the true
stone, and puts it in high place, wherever he finds
it. Such is the happy position of Homer, perhaps;
of Chaucer, of Saadi. They felt that all wit was
their wit. And they are librarians and historiographers,
as well as poets. Each romancer was
heir and dispenser of all the hundred tales of the
world,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Presenting Thebes&#8217; and Pelops&#8217; line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the tale of Troy divine.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The influence of Chaucer is conspicuous in all
our early literature; and, more recently, not only
Pope and Dryden have been beholden to him, but,
in the whole society of English writers, a large
unacknowledged debt is easily traced. One is
charmed with the opulence which feeds so many
pensioners. But Chaucer is a huge borrower.
Chaucer, it seems, drew continually, through
Lydgate and Caxton, from Guido di Colonna,
whose Latin romance of the Trojan war was in
turn a compilation from Dares Phrygius, Ovid,
and Statius. Then Petrarch, Boccaccio, and the
Proven&ccedil;al poets are his benefactors: the <i>Romaunt
of the Rose</i> is only judicious translation from
William of Lorris and John of Meun: <i>Troilus and
Creseide</i>, from Lollius of Urbino: <i>The Cock and
the Fox</i>, from the <i>Lais</i> of Marie: <i>The House of
Fame</i>, from the French or Italian: and poor
Gower he uses as if he were only a brick-kiln or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
stone-quarry, out of which to build his house. He
steals by this apology; that what he takes has no
worth where he finds it, and the greatest where he
leaves it. It has come to be practically a sort of
rule in literature, that a man, having once shown
himself capable of original writing, is entitled
thenceforth to steal from the writings of others
at discretion. Thought is the property of him who
can entertain it; and of him who can adequately
place it. A certain awkwardness marks the use
of borrowed thoughts; but, as soon as we have
learned what to do with them, they become our
own.</p>

<p>Thus, all originality is relative. Every thinker
is retrospective. The learned member of the
legislature at Westminster or at Washington,
speaks and votes for thousands. Show us the
constituency, and the now invisible channels by
which the senator is made aware of their wishes,
the crowd of practical and knowing men, who, by
correspondence or conversation, are feeding him
with evidence, anecdotes, and estimates, and it
will bereave his fine attitude and resistance of
something of their impressiveness. As Sir Robert
Peel and Mr. Webster vote, so Locke and Rousseau
think for thousands; and so there were fountains
all around Homer, Menu, Saadi, or Milton, from
which they drew; friends, lovers, books, traditions,
proverbs,&mdash;all perished,&mdash;which, if seen,
would go to reduce the wonder. Did the bard
speak with authority? Did he feel himself overmatched
by any companion? The appeal is to
the consciousness of the writer. Is there at last
in his breast a Delphi whereof to ask concerning
any thought or thing, whether it be verily so, yea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
or nay? and to have answer, and to rely on that?
All the debts which such a man could contract to
other wit, would never disturb his consciousness
of originality: for the ministrations of books, and
of other minds, are a whiff of smoke to that most
private reality with which he has conversed.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that what is best written or done
by genius, in the world, was no man&#8217;s work, but
came by wide social labour, when a thousand
wrought like one, sharing the same impulse. Our
English Bible is a wonderful specimen of the
strength and music of the English language. But
it was not made by one man, or at one time; but
centuries and churches brought it to perfection;
There never was a time when there was not some
translation existing. The Liturgy, admired for its
energy and pathos, is an anthology of the piety of
ages and nations, a translation of the prayers and
forms of the Catholic church,&mdash;these collected, too,
in long periods, from the prayers and meditations
of every saint and sacred writer, all over the world.
Grotius makes the like remark in respect to the
Lord&#8217;s Prayer, that the single clauses of which it
is composed were already in use, in the time of
Christ, in the rabbinical forms. He picked out
the grains of gold. The nervous language of the
Common Law, the impressive forms of our courts,
and the precision and substantial truth of the
legal distinctions, are the contribution of all the
sharp-sighted, strong-minded men who have lived
in the countries where these laws govern. The
translation of Plutarch gets its excellence by being
translation on translation. There never was a
time when there was none. All the truly idiomatic
and national phrases are kept, and all others<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
successively picked out, and thrown away. Something
like the same process had gone on, long
before, with the originals of these books. The
world takes liberties with world-books. Vedas,
&AElig;sop&#8217;s Fables, Pilpay, Arabian Nights, Cid, Iliad,
Robin Hood, Scottish Minstrelsy, are not the work
of single men. In the composition of such works,
the time thinks, the market thinks, the mason,
the carpenter, the merchant, the farmer, the fop,
all think for us. Every book supplies its time with
one good word; every municipal law, every trade,
every folly of the day, and the generic catholic
genius who is not afraid or ashamed to owe his
originality to the originality of all, stands with the
next age as the recorder and embodiment of his
own.</p>

<p>We have to thank the researches of antiquaries,
and the Shakespeare Society, for ascertaining the
steps of the English drama, from the Mysteries
celebrated in churches and by churchmen, and the
final detachment from the church, and the completion
of secular plays, from <i>Ferrex and Porrex</i>,
and <i>Gammer Gurton&#8217;s Needle</i>, down to the possession
of the stage by the very pieces which Shakespeare
altered, remodelled, and finally made his
own. Elated with success, and piqued by the
growing interest of the problem, they have left no
bookstall unsearched, no chest in a garret unopened,
no file of old yellow accounts to decompose in
damp and worms, so keen was the hope to discover
whether the boy Shakespeare poached or not,
whether he held horses at the theatre door, whether
he kept school, and why he left in his will only his
second-best bed to Ann Hathaway, his wife.</p>

<p>There is somewhat touching in the madness with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
which the passing age mischooses the object on
which all candles shine, and all eyes are turned;
the care with which it registers every trifle touching
Queen Elizabeth, and King James, and the Essexes,
Leicesters, Burleighs, and Buckinghams; and lets
pass without a single valuable note the founder of
another dynasty, which alone will cause the Tudor
dynasty to be remembered,&mdash;the man who carries
the Saxon race in him by the inspiration which
feeds him, and on whose thoughts the foremost
people of the world are now for some ages to be
nourished, and minds to receive this and not
another bias. A popular player,&mdash;nobody suspected
he was the poet of the human race; and the secret
was kept as faithfully from poets and intellectual
men, as from courtiers and frivolous people. Bacon,
who took the inventory of the human understanding
for his times, never mentioned his name. Ben
Jonson, though we have strained his few words
of regard and panegyric, had no suspicion of the
elastic fame whose first vibrations he was attempting.
He no doubt thought the praise he has conceded
to him generous, and esteemed himself, out
of all question, the better poet of the two.</p>

<p>If it need wit to know wit, according to the
proverb, Shakespeare&#8217;s time should be capable
of recognizing it. Sir Henry Wotton was born
four years after Shakespeare, and died twenty-three
years after him; and I find, among his
correspondents and acquaintances, the following
persons: Theodore Beza, Isaac Casaubon, Sir
Philip Sidney, Earl of Essex, Lord Bacon, Sir
Walter Raleigh, John Milton, Sir Henry Vane,
Izaac Walton, Dr. Donne, Abraham Cowley,
Bellarmine, Charles Cotton, John Pym, John Hales,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
Kepler, Vieta, Albericus Gentilis, Paul Sarpi,
Arminius; with all of whom exists some token of
his having communicated, without enumerating
many others, whom doubtless he saw,&mdash;Shakespeare,
Spenser, Jonson, Beaumont, Massinger, two
Herberts, Marlowe, Chapman, and the rest. Since
the constellation of great men who appeared in
Greece in the time of Pericles, there was never
any such society; yet their genius failed them to
find out the best head in the universe. Our poet&#8217;s
mask was impenetrable. You cannot see the
mountain near. It took a century to make it suspected;
and not until two centuries had passed,
after his death, did any criticism which we think
adequate begin to appear. It was not possible to
write the history of Shakespeare till now; for he
is the father of German literature: it was on the
introduction of Shakespeare into German, by
Lessing, and the translation of his works by
Wieland and Schlegel, that the rapid burst of
German literature was most intimately connected.
It was not until the nineteenth century, whose
speculative genius is a sort of living Hamlet, that
the tragedy of Hamlet could find such wondering
readers. Now, literature, philosophy, and thought
are Shakespearized. His mind is the horizon
beyond which, at present, we do not see. Our ears
are educated to music by his rhythm. Coleridge
and Goethe are the only critics who have expressed
our convictions with any adequate fidelity; but
there is in all cultivated minds a silent appreciation
of his superlative power and beauty, which, like
Christianity, qualifies the period.</p>

<p>The Shakespeare Society have inquired in all
directions, advertised the missing facts, offered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
money for any information that will lead to proof;
and with what result? Beside some important
illustration of the history of the English stage, to
which I have adverted, they have gleaned a few
facts touching the property, and dealings in regard
to property, of the poet. It appears that, from
year to year, he owned a larger share in the
Blackfriars Theatre: its wardrobe and other
appurtenances were his; that he bought an estate
in his native village, with his earnings, as writer
and shareholder; that he lived in the best house
in Stratford; was intrusted by his neighbours with
their commissions in London, as of borrowing
money, and the like; that he was a veritable
farmer. About the time when he was writing
<i>Macbeth</i>, he sues Philip Rogers, in the borough-court
of Stratford, for thirty-five shillings, ten
pence, for corn delivered to him at different times;
and, in all respects, appears as a good husband,
with no reputation for eccentricity or excess. He
was a good-natured sort of man, an actor and
shareholder in the theatre, not in any striking
manner distinguished from other actors and
managers. I admit the importance of this information.
It was well worth the pains that have
been taken to procure it.</p>

<p>But whatever scraps of information concerning
his condition these researches may have rescued,
they can shed no light upon that infinite invention
which is the concealed magnet of his attraction
for us. We are very clumsy writers of history.
We tell the chronicle of parentage, birth, birthplace,
schooling, schoolmates, earning of money,
marriage, publication of books, celebrity, death;
and when we have come to an end of this gossip,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
no ray of relation appears between it and the
goddess-born; and it seems as if, had we dipped
at random into the <i>Modern Plutarch</i> and read any
other life there, it would have fitted the poems
as well. It is the essence of poetry to spring, like
the rainbow daughter of Wonder, from the invisible,
to abolish the past, and refuse all history.
Malone, Warburton, Dyce, and Collier have wasted
their oil. The famed theatres, Covent Garden,
Drury Lane, the Park, and Tremont, have vainly
assisted. Betterton, Garrick, Kemble, Kean, and
Macready dedicate their lives to this genius; him
they crown, elucidate, obey, and express. The
genius knows them not. The recitation begins;
one golden word leaps out immortal from all this
painted pedantry, and sweetly torments us with
invitations to its own inaccessible homes. I
remember, I went once to see the Hamlet of a
famed performer, the pride of the English stage;
and all I then heard, and all I now remember, of
the tragedian, was that in which the tragedian
had no part; simply, Hamlet&#8217;s question to the
ghost:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i7">What may this mean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revisit&#8217;st thus the glimpses of the moon?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">That imagination which dilates the closet he
writes in to the world&#8217;s dimension, crowds it with
agents in rank and order, as quickly reduces the
big reality to be the glimpses of the moon. These
tricks of his magic spoil for us the illusions of the
green-room. Can any biography shed light on the
localities into which the <i>Midsummer Night&#8217;s
Dream</i> admits me? Did Shakespeare confide to
any notary or parish recorder, sacristan, or surrogate,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
in Stratford, the genesis of that delicate
creation? The forest of Arden, the nimble air of
Scone Castle, the moonlight of Portia&#8217;s villa, &#8216;the
antres vast and desarts idle&#8217; of Othello&#8217;s captivity,&mdash;where
is the third cousin, or grand-nephew,
the chancellor&#8217;s file of accounts, or private letter,
that has kept one word of those transcendent
secrets? In fine, in this drama, as in all great
works of art,&mdash;in the Cyclopean architecture of
Egypt and India; in the Phidian sculpture; the
Gothic minsters; the Italian painting; the
Ballads of Spain and Scotland;&mdash;the Genius draws
up the ladder after him, when the creative age
goes up to heaven, and gives way to a new age,
which sees the works, and asks in vain for a
history.</p>

<p>Shakespeare is the only biographer of Shakespeare;
and even he can tell nothing, except to the
Shakespeare in us; that is, to our most apprehensive
and sympathetic hour. He cannot step
from off his tripod, and give us anecdotes of his
inspirations. Read the antique documents extricated,
analysed, and compared by the assiduous
Dyce and Collier; and now read one of those
skyey sentences,&mdash;aerolites,&mdash;which seem to have
fallen out of heaven, and which, not your experience,
but the man within the breast, has accepted
as words of fate; and tell me if they match; if
the former account in any manner for the latter;
or which gives the most historical insight into
the man.</p>

<p>Hence, though our external history is so meagre,
yet with Shakespeare for biographer, instead of
Aubrey and Rowe, we have really the information
which is material, that which describes character<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
and fortune, that which, if we were about to meet
the man and deal with him, would most import
us to know. We have his recorded convictions on
those questions which knock for answer at every
heart,&mdash;on life and death, on love, on wealth and
poverty, on the prizes of life, and the ways whereby
we come at them; on the characters of men, and
the influences, occult and open, which affect their
fortunes; and on those mysterious and demoniacal
powers which defy our science, and which yet
interweave their malice and their gift in our
brightest hours. Who ever read the volume of the
Sonnets, without finding that the poet had there
revealed, under masks that are no masks to the
intelligent, the lore of friendship and of love; the
confusion of sentiments in the most susceptible,
and, at the same time, the most intellectual of
men? What trait of his private mind has he
hidden in his dramas? One can discern, in his
ample pictures of the gentleman and the king,
what forms and humanities pleased him; his
delight in troops of friends, in large hospitality,
in cheerful giving. Let Timon, let Warwick, let
Antonio the merchant, answer for his great heart.
So far from Shakespeare&#8217;s being the least known,
he is the one person, in all modern history, known
to us. What point of morals, of manners, of
economy, of philosophy, of religion, of taste, of
the conduct of life, has he not settled? What
mystery has he not signified his knowledge of?
What office, or function, or district of man&#8217;s work,
has he not remembered? What king has he not
taught state, as Talma taught Napoleon? What
maiden has not found him finer than her delicacy?
What lover has he not outloved? What sage has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
he not outseen? What gentleman has he not
instructed in the rudeness of his behaviour?</p>

<p>Some able and appreciating critics think no
criticism on Shakespeare valuable, that does not
rest purely on the dramatic merit; that he is
falsely judged as poet and philosopher. I think
as highly as these critics of his dramatic merit, but
still think it secondary. He was a full man, who
liked to talk; a brain exhaling thoughts and
images, which, seeking vent, found the drama next
at hand. Had he been less, we should have had
to consider how well he filled his place, how good
a dramatist he was, and he is the best in the world.
But it turns out, that what he has to say is of that
weight as to withdraw some attention from the
vehicle; and he is like some saint whose history
is to be rendered into all languages, into verse and
prose, into songs and pictures, and cut up into
proverbs; so that the occasion which gave the
saint&#8217;s meaning the form of a conversation, or of
a prayer, or of a code of laws, is immaterial, compared
with the universality of its application. So
it fares with the wise Shakespeare and his book of
life. He wrote the airs for all our modern music:
he wrote the text of modern life; the text of
manners: he drew the man of England and
Europe; the father of the man in America: he
drew the man, and described the day, and what is
done in it; he read the hearts of men and women,
their probity, and their second thought, and wiles;
the wiles of innocence, and the transitions by which
virtues and vices slide into their contraries: he
could divide the mother&#8217;s part from the father&#8217;s
part in the face of the child, or draw the fine
demarcations of freedom and of fate: he knew the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
laws of repression which make the police of nature;
and all the sweets and all the terrors of human lot
lay in his mind as truly but as softly as the landscape
lies on the eye. And the importance of this
wisdom of life sinks the form, as of Drama or Epic,
out of notice. &#8217;Tis like making a question concerning
the paper on which a king&#8217;s message is written.</p>

<p>Shakespeare is as much out of the category of
eminent authors, as he is out of the crowd. He
is inconceivably wise; the others, conceivably.
A good reader can, in a sort, nestle into Plato&#8217;s
brain, and think from thence; but not into Shakespeare&#8217;s.
We are still out of doors. For executive
faculty, for creation, Shakespeare is unique. No
man can imagine it better. He was the farthest
reach of subtlety compatible with an individual
self,&mdash;the subtilest of authors, and only just within
the possibility of authorship. With this wisdom
of life, is the equal endowment of imaginative and
of lyric power. He clothed the creatures of his
legend with form and sentiments, as if they were
people who had lived under his roof; and few real
men have left such distinct characters as these
fictions. And they spoke in language as sweet as
it was fit. Yet his talents never seduced him into
an ostentation, nor did he harp on one string. An
omnipresent humanity co-ordinates all his faculties.
Give a man of talents a story to tell, and
his partiality will presently appear. He has certain
observations, opinions, topics, which have some
accidental prominence, and which he disposes all
to exhibit. He crams this part, and starves that
other part, consulting not the fitness of the thing,
but his fitness and strength. But Shakespeare has
no peculiarity, no importunate topic; but all is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
duly given; no veins, no curiosities: no cow-painter,
no bird-fancier, no mannerist is he: he
has no discoverable egotism: the great he tells
greatly; the small, subordinately. He is wise
without emphasis or assertion; he is strong, as
nature is strong, who lifts the land into mountain
slopes without effort, and by the same rule as she
floats a bubble in the air, and likes as well to do
the one as the other. This makes that equality of
power in farce, tragedy, narrative, and love-songs;
a merit so incessant, that each reader is incredulous
of the perception of other readers.</p>

<p>This power of expression, or of transferring the
inmost truth of things into music and verse, makes
him the type of the poet, and has added a new
problem to metaphysics. This is that which
throws him into natural history, as a main production
of the globe, and as announcing new eras
and ameliorations. Things were mirrored in his
poetry without loss or blur; he could paint the
fine with precision, the great with compass; the
tragic and the comic indifferently, and without any
distortion or favour. He carried his powerful
execution into minute details, to a hair point;
finishes an eyelash or a dimple as firmly as he
draws a mountain; and yet these, like nature&#8217;s,
will bear the scrutiny of the solar microscope.</p>

<p>In short, he is the chief example to prove that
more or less of production, more or fewer pictures,
is a thing indifferent. He had the power to make
one picture. Daguerre learned how to let one
flower etch its image on his plate of iodine;
and then proceeds at leisure to etch a million.
There are always objects; but there was never
representation. Here is perfect representation, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
last; and now let the world of figures sit for their
portraits. No recipe can be given for the making
of a Shakespeare; but the possibility of the
translation of things into song is demonstrated.</p>

<p>His lyric power lies in the genius of the piece.
The sonnets, though their excellence is lost in the
splendour of the dramas, are as inimitable as they;
and it is not a merit of lines, but a total merit of the
piece; like the tone of voice of some incomparable
person, so is this a speech of poetic beings, and any
clause as unproducible now as a whole poem.</p>

<p>Though the speeches in the plays, and single
lines, have a beauty which tempts the ear to pause
on them for their euphuism, yet the sentence is so
loaded with meaning, and so linked with its foregoers
and followers, that the logician is satisfied.
His means are as admirable as his ends; every
subordinate invention, by which he helps himself
to connect some irreconcilable opposites, is a poem
too. He is not reduced to dismount and walk,
because his horses are running off with him in
some distant direction: he always rides.</p>

<p>The finest poetry was first experience: but the
thought has suffered a transformation since it was
an experience. Cultivated men often attain a good
degree of skill in writing verses; but it is easy to
read, through their poems, their personal history:
any one acquainted with parties can name every
figure: this is Andrew, and that is Rachel. The
sense thus remains prosaic. It is a caterpillar with
wings, and not yet a butterfly. In the poet&#8217;s mind,
the fact has gone quite over into the new element
of thought, and has lost all that is exuvial. This
generosity abides with Shakespeare. We say, from
the truth and closeness of his pictures, that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
knows the lesson by heart. Yet there is not a trace
of egotism.</p>

<p>One more royal trait properly belongs to the
poet. I mean his cheerfulness, without which no
man can be a poet,&mdash;for beauty is his aim. He loves
virtue, not for its obligation, but for its grace: he
delights in the world, in man, in woman, for the
lovely light that sparkles from them. Beauty, the
spirit of joy and hilarity, he sheds over the universe.
Epicurus relates that poetry hath such charms
that a lover might forsake his mistress to partake
of them. And the true bards have been noted for
their firm and cheerful temper. Homer lies in
sunshine; Chaucer is glad and erect; and Saadi
says, &#8216;It was rumoured abroad that I was penitent;
but what had I to do with repentance?&#8217; Not less
sovereign and cheerful,&mdash;much more sovereign and
cheerful, is the tone of Shakespeare. His name
suggests joy and emancipation to the heart of
men. If he should appear in any company of
human souls, who would not march in his troop?
He touches nothing that does not borrow health
and longevity from his festal style.</p>


<p class="newsection">And now, how stands the account of man with
this bard and benefactor, when in solitude, shutting
our ears to the reverberations of his fame, we seek
to strike the balance? Solitude has austere lessons;
it can teach us to spare both heroes and poets;
and it weighs Shakespeare also, and finds him to
share the halfness and imperfection of humanity.</p>

<p>Shakespeare, Homer, Dante, Chaucer, saw the
splendour of meaning that plays over the visible
world; knew that a tree had another use than for
apples, and corn another than for meal, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
ball of the earth, than for tillage and roads: that
these things bore a second and finer harvest to the
mind, being emblems of its thoughts, and conveying
in all their natural history a certain mute
commentary on human life. Shakespeare employed
them as colours to compose his picture. He rested
in their beauty; and never took the step which
seemed inevitable to such genius, namely, to
explore the virtue which resides in these symbols,
and imparts this power,&mdash;What is that which they
themselves say? He converted the elements,
which waited on his command, into entertainments.
He was master of the revels to mankind.
Is it not as if one should have, through majestic
powers of science, the comets given into his hand,
or the planets and their moons, and should draw
them from their orbits to glare with the municipal
fireworks on a holiday night, and advertise in all
towns, &#8216;very superior pyrotechny this evening!&#8217;
Are the agents of nature, and the power to understand
them, worth no more than a street serenade,
or the breath of a cigar? One remembers again
the trumpet-text in the Koran,&mdash;&#8216;The heavens
and the earth, and all that is between them, think
ye we have created them in jest?&#8217; As long as the
question is of talent and mental power, the world
of men has not his equal to show. But when the
question is to life, and its materials, and its auxiliaries,
how does he profit me? What does it
signify? It is but a Twelfth Night, or Midsummer
Night&#8217;s Dream, or a Winter Evening&#8217;s Tale: what
signifies another picture more or less? The Egyptian
verdict of the Shakespeare Societies comes to
mind, that he was a jovial actor and manager. I
cannot marry this fact to his verse. Other admirable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
men have led lives in some sort of keeping
with their thought; but this man, in wide contrast.
Had he been less, had he reached only the
common measure of great authors, of Bacon,
Milton, Tasso, Cervantes, we might leave the fact
in the twilight of human fate: but, that this man
of men, he who gave to the science of mind a new
and larger subject than had ever existed, and
planted the standard of humanity some furlongs
forward into Chaos,&mdash;that he should not be wise for
himself,&mdash;it must even go into the world&#8217;s history,
that the best poet led an obscure and profane life,
using his genius for the public amusement.</p>

<p>Well, other men, priest and prophet, Israelite,
German, and Swede, beheld the same objects:
they also saw through them that which was contained.
And to what purpose? The beauty
straightway vanished; they read commandments,
all-excluding mountainous duty; an obligation,
a sadness, as of piled mountains, fell on them, and
life became ghastly, joyless, a pilgrim&#8217;s progress,
a probation, beleaguered round with doleful histories
of Adam&#8217;s fall and curse, behind us; with
doomsdays and purgatorial and penal fires before
us; and the heart of the seer and the heart of the
listener sank in them.</p>

<p>It must be conceded that these are half-views of
half-men. The world still wants its poet-priest, a
reconciler, who shall not trifle with Shakespeare
the player, nor shall grope in graves with Swedenborg
the mourner; but who shall see, speak, and
act, with equal inspiration. For knowledge will
brighten the sunshine; right is more beautiful
than private affection; and love is compatible
with universal wisdom.</p>

<h3>WORDSWORTH (1875)</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A generation</span> has now passed away since
Wordsworth was laid with the family in the churchyard
at Grasmere. Perhaps it is hardly yet time
to take a perfectly impartial measure of his value as
a poet. To do this is especially hard for those who
are old enough to remember the last shot which the
foe was sullenly firing in that long war of critics
which began when he published his manifesto as
Pretender, and which came to a pause rather than
end when they flung up their caps with the rest
at his final coronation. Something of the intensity
of the <i>odium theologicum</i> (if indeed the <i>aestheticum</i>
be not in these days the more bitter of the two)
entered into the conflict. The Wordsworthians
were a sect, who, if they had the enthusiasm, had
also not a little of the exclusiveness and partiality
to which sects are liable. The verses of the master
had for them the virtue of religious canticles
stimulant of zeal and not amenable to the ordinary
tests of cold-blooded criticism. Like the hymns
of the Huguenots and Covenanters, they were songs
of battle no less than of worship, and the combined
ardours of conviction and conflict lent them a fire
that was not naturally their own. As we read
them now, that virtue of the moment is gone out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
them, and whatever of Dr. Wattsiness there is gives
us a slight shock of disenchantment. It is something
like the difference between the <i>Marseillaise</i> sung by
armed propagandists on the edge of battle, or by
Brissotins in the tumbrel, and the words of it read
coolly in the closet, or recited with the factitious
frenzy of Th&eacute;r&egrave;se. It was natural in the early days
of Wordsworth&#8217;s career to dwell most fondly on
those profounder qualities to appreciate which
settled in some sort the measure of a man&#8217;s right
to judge of poetry at all. But now we must admit
the shortcomings, the failures, the defects, as no
less essential elements in forming a sound judgement
as to whether the seer and artist were so united
in him as to justify the claim first put in by himself
and afterwards maintained by his sect to a place
beside the few great poets who exalt men&#8217;s minds,
and give a right direction and safe outlet to their
passions through the imagination, while insensibly
helping them toward balance of character and
serenity of judgement by stimulating their sense of
proportion, form, and the nice adjustment of
means to ends. In none of our poets has the
constant propulsion of an unbending will, and the
concentration of exclusive, if I must not say somewhat
narrow, sympathies done so much to make
the original endowment of nature effective, and in
none accordingly does the biography throw so
much light on the works, or enter so largely into
their composition as an element whether of power
or of weakness. Wordsworth never saw, and
I think never wished to see, beyond the limits
of his own consciousness and experience. He early
conceived himself to be, and through life was confirmed
by circumstances in the faith that he was,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
a &#8216;dedicated spirit&#8217;,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> a state of mind likely to
further an intense but at the same time one-sided
development of the intellectual powers. The
solitude in which the greater part of his mature life
was passed, while it doubtless ministered to the
passionate intensity of his musings upon man and
nature, was, it may be suspected, harmful to him
as an artist, by depriving him of any standard of
proportion outside himself by which to test the
comparative value of his thoughts, and by rendering
him more and more incapable of that urbanity
of mind which could be gained only by commerce
with men more nearly on his own level, and which
gives tone without lessening individuality. Wordsworth
never quite saw the distinction between the
eccentric and the original. For what we call
originality seems not so much anything peculiar,
much less anything odd, but that quality in a man
which touches human nature at most points of its
circumference, which reinvigorates the consciousness
of our own powers by recalling and confirming
our own unvalued sensations and perceptions, gives
classic shape to our own amorphous imaginings,
and adequate utterance to our own stammering
conceptions or emotions. The poet&#8217;s office is to
be a Voice, not of one crying in the wilderness to
a knot of already magnetized acolytes, but singing
amid the throng of men, and lifting their common
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>aspirations and sympathies (so first clearly revealed
to themselves) on the wings of his song to a purer
ether and a wider reach of view. We cannot, if we
would, read the poetry of Wordsworth as mere
poetry; at every other page we find ourselves
entangled in a problem of aesthetics. The world-old
question of matter and form, of whether nectar
<i>is</i> of precisely the same flavour when served to us
from a Grecian chalice or from any jug of ruder
pottery, comes up for decision anew. The Teutonic
nature has always shown a sturdy preference of
the solid bone with a marrow of nutritious moral
to any shadow of the same on the flowing mirror
of sense. Wordsworth never lets us long forget
the deeply rooted stock from which he sprang,&mdash;<i>vien
ben d&agrave; lui</i>.</p>


<p class="newsection">William Wordsworth was born at Cockermouth
in Cumberland on the 7th of April, 1770, the
second of five children. His father was John
Wordsworth, an attorney-at-law, and agent of Sir
James Lowther, afterwards first Earl of Lonsdale.
His mother was Anne Cookson, the daughter of
a mercer in Penrith. His paternal ancestors had
been settled immemorially at Penistone in Yorkshire,
whence his grandfather had emigrated to
Westmorland. His mother, a woman of piety
and wisdom, died in March 1778, being then in
her thirty-second year. His father, who never
entirely cast off the depression occasioned by her
death, survived her but five years, dying in
December 1783, when William was not quite
fourteen years old.</p>

<p>The poet&#8217;s early childhood was passed partly
at Cockermouth, and partly with his maternal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
grandfather at Penrith. His first teacher appears
to have been Mrs. Anne Birkett, a kind of Shenstone&#8217;s
Schoolmistress, who practised the memory
of her pupils, teaching them chiefly by rote, and not
endeavouring to cultivate their reasoning faculties,
a process by which children are apt to be converted
from natural logicians into impertinent sophists.
Among his schoolmates here was Mary Hutchinson,
who afterwards became his wife.</p>

<p>In 1778 he was sent to a school founded by
Edwin Sandys, Archbishop of York, in the year
1585, at Hawkshead in Lancashire. Hawkshead
is a small market-town in the vale of Esthwaite,
about a third of a mile north-west of the lake.
Here Wordsworth passed nine years, among a people
of simple habits and scenery of a sweet and pastoral
dignity. His earliest intimacies were with the
mountains, lakes, and streams of his native district,
and the associations with which his mind was
stored during its most impressible period were
noble and pure. The boys were boarded among
the dames of the village, thus enjoying a freedom
from scholastic restraints, which could be nothing
but beneficial in a place where the temptations were
only to sports that hardened the body, while they
fostered a love of nature in the spirit and habits of
observation in the mind. Wordsworth&#8217;s ordinary
amusements here were hunting and fishing, rowing,
skating, and long walks around the lake and
among the hills, with an occasional scamper on
horseback.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> His life as a schoolboy was favourable
also to his poetic development, in being
identified with that of the people among whom he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>lived. Among men of simple habits, and where
there are small diversities of condition, the feelings
and passions are displayed with less restraint, and
the young poet grew acquainted with that primal
human basis of character where the Muse finds firm
foothold, and to which he ever afterward cleared
his way through all the overlying drift of conventionalism.
The dalesmen were a primitive and
hardy race who kept alive the traditions and often
the habits of a more picturesque time. A common
level of interests and social standing fostered unconventional
ways of thought and speech, and friendly
human sympathies. Solitude induced reflection,
a reliance of the mind on its own resources, and
individuality of character. Where everybody
knew everybody, and everybody&#8217;s father had
known everybody&#8217;s father, the interest of man in
man was not likely to become a matter of cold
hearsay and distant report. When death knocked
at any door in the hamlet, there was an echo from
every fireside, and a wedding dropped its white
flowers at every threshold. There was not a grave
in the churchyard but had its story; not a crag or
glen or aged tree untouched with some ideal hue of
legend. It was here that Wordsworth learned that
homely humanity which gives such depth and
sincerity to his poems. Travel, society, culture,
nothing could obliterate the deep trace of that early
training which enables him to speak directly to the
primitive instincts of man. He was apprenticed
early to the difficult art of being himself.</p>

<p>At school he wrote some task-verses on subjects
imposed by the master, and also some voluntaries
of his own, equally undistinguished by any peculiar
merit. But he seems to have made up his mind as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
early as in his fourteenth year to become a poet.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
&#8216;It is recorded&#8217;, says his biographer vaguely, &#8216;that
the poet&#8217;s father set him very early to learn portions
of the best English poets by heart, so that at an
early age he could repeat large portions of Shakespeare,
Milton, and Spenser.&#8217;</p>

<p>The great event of Wordsworth&#8217;s schooldays was
the death of his father, who left what may be
called a hypothetical estate, consisting chiefly of
claims upon the first Earl of Lonsdale, the payment
of which, though their justice was acknowledged,
that nobleman contrived in some unexplained way
to elude so long as he lived. In October 1787 he
left school for St. John&#8217;s College, Cambridge. He
was already, we are told, a fair Latin scholar, and
had made some progress in mathematics. The
earliest books we hear of his reading were <i>Don
Quixote</i>, <i>Gil Blas</i>, <i>Gulliver&#8217;s Travels</i>, and the <i>Tale
of a Tub</i>; but at school he had also become
familiar with the works of some English poets,
particularly Goldsmith and Gray, of whose poems
he had learned many by heart. What is more to
the purpose, he had become, without knowing it,
a lover of Nature in all her moods, and the same
mental necessities of a solitary life which compel
men to an interest in the transitory phenomena
of scenery, had made him also studious of the
movements of his own mind, and the mutual interaction
and dependence of the external and internal
universe.</p>

<p>Doubtless his early orphanage was not without
its effect in confirming a character naturally impatient
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>of control, and his mind, left to itself,
clothed itself with an indigenous growth, which
grew fairly and freely, unstinted by the shadow of
exotic plantations. It has become a truism, that
remarkable persons have remarkable mothers;
but perhaps this is chiefly true of such as have
made themselves distinguished by their industry,
and by the assiduous cultivation of faculties in
themselves of only an average quality. It is rather
to be noted how little is known of the parentage of
men of the first magnitude, how often they seem in
some sort foundlings, and how early an apparently
adverse destiny begins the culture of those who are
to encounter and master great intellectual or
spiritual experiences.</p>

<p>Of his disposition as a child little is known, but
that little is characteristic. He himself tells us
that he was &#8216;stiff, moody, and of violent temper&#8217;.
His mother said of him that he was the only one
of her children about whom she felt any anxiety,&mdash;for
she was sure that he would be remarkable for
good or evil. Once, in resentment at some fancied
injury, he resolved to kill himself, but his heart
failed him. I suspect that few boys of passionate
temperament have escaped these momentary suggestions
of despairing helplessness. &#8216;On another
occasion,&#8217; he says, &#8216;while I was at my grandfather&#8217;s
house at Penrith, along with my eldest
brother Richard, we were whipping tops together
in the long drawing-room, on which the carpet was
only laid down on particular occasions. The walls
were hung round with family pictures, and I said to
my brother, &#8220;Dare you strike your whip through
that old lady&#8217;s petticoat?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;No, I
won&#8217;t.&#8221; &#8220;Then,&#8221; said I, &#8220;here goes,&#8221; and I struck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
my lash through her hooped petticoat, for which,
no doubt, though I have forgotten it, I was properly
punished. But, possibly from some want of judgement
in punishments inflicted, I had become perverse
and obstinate in defying chastisement, and
rather proud of it than otherwise.&#8217; This last
anecdote is as happily typical as a bit of Greek
mythology which always prefigured the lives of
heroes in the stories of their childhood. Just so do
we find him afterward striking his defiant lash
through the hooped petticoat of the artificial style
of poetry, and proudly unsubdued by the punishment
of the Reviewers.</p>

<p>Of his college life the chief record is to be found
in <i>The Prelude</i>. He did not distinguish himself as
a scholar, and if his life had any incidents, they were
of that interior kind which rarely appear in biography,
though they may be of controlling influence
upon the life. He speaks of reading Chaucer,
Spenser, and Milton while at Cambridge,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> but no
reflection from them is visible in his earliest
published poems. The greater part of his vacations
was spent in his native Lake-country, where
his only sister, Dorothy, was the companion of
his rambles. She was a woman of large natural
endowments, chiefly of the receptive kind, and had
much to do with the formation and tendency of the
poet&#8217;s mind. It was she who called forth the shyer
sensibilities of his nature, and taught an originally
harsh and austere imagination to surround itself
with fancy and feeling, as the rock fringes itself
with a sun-spray of ferns. She was his first public,
and belonged to that class of prophetically appreciative
temperaments whose apparent office it is to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>cheer the early solitude of original minds with
messages from the future. Through the greater
part of his life she continued to be a kind of poetical
conscience to him.</p>

<p>Wordsworth&#8217;s last college vacation was spent in
a foot journey upon the Continent (1790). In
January 1791 he took his degree of B.A., and left
Cambridge. During the summer of this year he
visited Wales, and, after declining to enter upon
holy orders under the plea that he was not of age
for ordination, went over to France in November,
and remained during the winter at Orleans. Here
he became intimate with the republican General
Beaupuis, with whose hopes and aspirations he
ardently sympathized. In the spring of 1792
he was at Blois, and returned thence to Orleans,
which he finally quitted in October for Paris. He
remained here as long as he could with safety, and
at the close of the year went back to England, thus,
perhaps, escaping the fate which soon after overtook
his friends the Brissotins.</p>

<p>As hitherto the life of Wordsworth may be called
a fortunate one, not less so in the training and
expansion of his faculties was this period of his stay
in France. Born and reared in a country where the
homely and familiar nestles confidingly amid the
most savage and sublime forms of nature, he had
experienced whatever impulses the creative faculty
can receive from mountain and cloud and the voices
of winds and waters, but he had known man only
as an actor in fireside histories and tragedies, for
which the hamlet supplied an ample stage. In
France he first felt the authentic beat of a nation&#8217;s
heart; he was a spectator at one of those dramas
where the terrible footfall of the Eumenides is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
heard nearer and nearer in the pauses of the action;
and he saw man such as he can only be when he is
vibrated by the orgasm of a national emotion. He
sympathized with the hopes of France and of mankind
deeply, as was fitting in a young man and
a poet; and if his faith in the gregarious advancement
of men was afterward shaken, he only held
the more firmly by his belief in the individual, and
his reverence for the human as something quite
apart from the popular and above it. Wordsworth
has been unwisely blamed, as if he had been recreant
to the liberal instincts of his youth. But it was
inevitable that a genius so regulated and metrical
as his, a mind which always compensated itself for
its artistic radicalism by an involuntary leaning
toward external respectability, should recoil from
whatever was convulsionary and destructive in
politics, and above all in religion. He reads the
poems of Wordsworth without understanding, who
does not find in them the noblest incentives to faith
in man and the grandeur of his destiny, founded
always upon that personal dignity and virtue, the
capacity for whose attainment alone makes universal
liberty possible and assures its permanence.
He was to make men better by opening to them
the sources of an inalterable well-being; to make
them free, in a sense higher than political, by showing
them that these sources are within them, and
that no contrivance of man can permanently emancipate
narrow natures and depraved minds. His
politics were always those of a poet, circling in the
larger orbit of causes and principles, careless of the
transitory oscillation of events.</p>

<p>The change in his point of view (if change there
was) certainly was complete soon after his return<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
from France, and was perhaps due in part to the
influence of Burke.</p>

<p>He had seen the French for a dozen years eagerly
busy in tearing up whatever had roots in the past,
replacing the venerable trunks of tradition and
orderly growth with liberty-poles, then striving
vainly to piece together the fibres they had broken,
and to reproduce artificially that sense of permanence
and continuity which is the main safeguard
of vigorous self-consciousness in a nation.
He became a Tory through intellectual conviction,
retaining, I suspect, to the last, a certain radicalism
of temperament and instinct. Haydon tells us
that in 1809 Sir George Beaumont said to him
and Wilkie, &#8216;Wordsworth may perhaps walk in; if
he do, I caution you both against his terrific democratic
notions&#8217;; and it must have been many years
later that Wordsworth himself told Crabb Robinson,
&#8216;I have no respect whatever for Whigs, but I have
a great deal of the Chartist in me&#8217;. In 1802, during
his tour in Scotland, he travelled on Sundays as on
the other days of the week. He afterwards became
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>a theoretical churchgoer. &#8216;Wordsworth defended
earnestly the Church establishment. He even said
he would shed his blood for it. Nor was he disconcerted
by a laugh raised against him on account
of his having confessed that he knew not when he
had been in a church in his own country. &#8220;All our
ministers are so vile,&#8221; said he. The mischief of
allowing the clergy to depend on the caprice of the
multitude he thought more than outweighed all the
evils of an establishment.&#8217;</p>

<p>In December 1792 Wordsworth had returned to
England, and in the following year published
<i>Descriptive Sketches</i> and the <i>Evening Walk</i>. He
did this, as he says in one of his letters, to show
that, although he had gained no honours at the
University, he <i>could</i> do something. They met
with no great success, and he afterward corrected
them so much as to destroy all their interest as
juvenile productions, without communicating to
them any of the merits of maturity. In commenting,
sixty years afterward, on a couplet in one of
these poems,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And, fronting the bright west, the oak entwines<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its darkening boughs and leaves in stronger lines,&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">he says: &#8216;This is feebly and imperfectly expressed,
but I recollect distinctly the very spot where this
first struck me.... The moment was important
in my poetical history; for I date from it my consciousness
of the infinite variety of natural appearances
which had been unnoticed by the poets of any
age or country, so far as I was acquainted with
them, and I made a resolution to supply in some
degree the deficiency.&#8217;</p>

<p>It is plain that Wordsworth&#8217;s memory was playing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
him a trick here, misled by that instinct (it may
almost be called) of consistency which leads men
first to desire that their lives should have been
without break or seam, and then to believe that
they have been such. The more distant ranges
of perspective are apt to run together in retrospection.
How far could Wordsworth at fourteen have
been acquainted with the poets of all ages and
countries,&mdash;he who to his dying day could not
endure to read Goethe and knew nothing of
Calderon? It seems to me rather that the earliest
influence traceable in him is that of Goldsmith, and
later of Cowper, and it is, perhaps, some slight indication
of its having already begun that his first
volume of <i>Descriptive Sketches</i> (1793) was put
forth by Johnson, who was Cowper&#8217;s publisher.
By and by the powerful impress of Burns is seen
both in the topics of his verse and the form of his
expression. But whatever their ultimate effect
upon his style, certain it is that his juvenile poems
were clothed in the conventional habit of the
eighteenth century. &#8216;The first verses from which
he remembered to have received great pleasure
were Miss Carter&#8217;s <i>Poem on Spring</i>, a poem in the
six-line stanza which he was particularly fond
of and had composed much in,&mdash;for example,
<i>Ruth</i>.&#8217; This is noteworthy, for Wordsworth&#8217;s
lyric range, especially so far as tune is concerned,
was always narrow. His sense of melody was
painfully dull, and some of his lighter effusions, as
he would have called them, are almost ludicrously
wanting in grace of movement. We cannot expect
in a modern poet the thrush-like improvisation,
the impulsively bewitching cadences, that charm
us in our Elizabethan drama and whose last warble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
died with Herrick; but Shelley, Tennyson, and
Browning have shown that the simple pathos of
their music was not irrecoverable, even if the artless
poignancy of their phrase be gone beyond recall.
We feel this lack in Wordsworth all the more keenly
if we compare such verses as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Like an army defeated<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The snow hath retreated<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now doth fare ill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the top of the bare hill,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">with Goethe&#8217;s exquisite <i>Ueber allen Gipfeln ist Ruh</i>,
in which the lines (as if shaken down by a momentary
breeze of emotion) drop lingeringly one after
another like blossoms upon turf.</p>

<p><i>The Evening Walk</i> and <i>Descriptive Sketches</i> show
plainly the prevailing influence of Goldsmith, both
in the turn of thought and the mechanism of
the verse. They lack altogether the temperance
of tone and judgement in selection which have
made the <i>Traveller</i> and the <i>Deserted Village</i> perhaps
the most truly classical poems in the language.
They bear here and there, however, the unmistakable
stamp of the maturer Wordsworth, not only
in a certain blunt realism, but in the intensity and
truth of picturesque epithet. Of this realism,
from which Wordsworth never wholly freed himself,
the following verses may suffice as a specimen.
After describing the fate of a chamois-hunter killed
by falling from a crag, his fancy goes back to the
bereaved wife and son:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Haply that child in fearful doubt may gaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passing his father&#8217;s bones in future days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Start at the reliques of that very thigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On which so oft he prattled when a boy.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span></div></div>

<p class="noin">In these poems there is plenty of that &#8216;poetic
diction&#8217; against which Wordsworth was to lead the
revolt nine years later.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To wet the peak&#8217;s impracticable sides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He opens of his feet the sanguine tides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weak and more weak the issuing current eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lapped by the panting tongue of thirsty skies.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Both of these passages have disappeared from the
revised edition, as well as some curious outbursts
of that motiveless despair which Byron made
fashionable not long after. Nor are there wanting
touches of fleshliness which strike us oddly as
coming from Wordsworth.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Farewell! those forms that in thy noontide shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rest near their little plots of oaten glade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those steadfast eyes that beating breasts inspire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To throw the &#8216;sultry ray&#8217; of young Desire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those lips whose tides of fragrance come and go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accordant to the cheek&#8217;s unquiet glow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those shadowy breasts in love&#8217;s soft light arrayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rising by the moon of passion swayed.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">The political tone is also mildened in the revision,
as where he changes &#8216;despotcourts&#8217; into &#8216;tyranny&#8217;.
One of the alterations is interesting. In the
<i>Evening Walk</i> he had originally written</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And bids her soldier come her wars to share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Asleep on Minden&#8217;s charnel hill afar.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">An erratum at the end directs us to correct the
second verse, thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Asleep on Bunker&#8217;s charnel hill afar.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Wordsworth somewhere rebukes the poets for
making the owl a bodeful bird. He had himself
done so in the <i>Evening Walk</i>, and corrects his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
epithets to suit his later judgement, putting &#8216;gladsome&#8217;
for &#8216;boding&#8217;, and replacing</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The tremulous sob of the complaining owl<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">by</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The sportive outcry of the mocking owl.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Indeed, the character of the two poems is so much
changed in the revision as to make the dates
appended to them a misleading anachronism. But
there is one truly Wordsworthian passage which
already gives us a glimpse of that passion with
which he was the first to irradiate descriptive
poetry and which sets him on a level with Turner.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8217;Tis storm; and hid in mist from hour to hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All day the floods a deepening murmur pour:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sky is veiled and every cheerful sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark is the region as with coming night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what a sudden burst of overpowering light!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Triumphant on the bosom of the storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glances the fire-clad eagle&#8217;s wheeling form;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eastward, in long prospective glittering shine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wood-crowned cliffs that o&#8217;er the lake recline;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those eastern cliffs a hundred streams unfold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once to pillars turned that flame with gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind his sail the peasant tries to shun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The West that burns like one dilated sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where in a mighty crucible expire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mountains, glowing hot like coals of fire.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Wordsworth has made only one change in these
verses, and that for the worse, by substituting
&#8216;glorious&#8217; (which was already implied in &#8216;glances&#8217;
and &#8216;fire-clad&#8217;) for &#8216;wheeling&#8217;. In later life he
would have found it hard to forgive the man who
should have made cliffs recline over a lake. On
the whole, what strikes us as most prophetic in
these poems is their want of continuity, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
purple patches of true poetry on a texture of
unmistakable prose; perhaps we might add the
incongruous clothing of prose thoughts in the
ceremonial robes of poesy.</p>

<p>During the same year (1793) he wrote, but did
not publish, a political tract, in which he avowed
himself opposed to monarchy and to the hereditary
principle, and desirous of a republic, if it could be
had without a revolution. He probably continued
to be all his life in favour of that ideal republic
&#8216;which never was on land or sea&#8217;, but fortunately
he gave up politics that he might devote himself
to his own nobler calling, to which politics are
subordinate, and for which he found freedom
enough in England as it was. Dr. Wordsworth
admits that his uncle&#8217;s opinions were democratical
so late as 1802. I suspect that they remained so in
an esoteric way to the end of his days. He had
himself suffered by the arbitrary selfishness of
a great landholder, and he was born and bred in
a part of England where there is a greater social
equality than elsewhere. The look and manner of
the Cumberland people especially are such as recall
very vividly to a New-Englander the associations
of fifty years ago, ere the change from New England
to New Ireland had begun. But meanwhile, Want,
which makes no distinctions of Monarchist or
Republican, was pressing upon him. The debt due
to his father&#8217;s estate had not been paid, and
Wordsworth was one of those rare idealists who
esteem it the first duty of a friend of humanity to
live for, and not on, his neighbour. He at first
proposed establishing a periodical journal to be
called <i>The Philanthropist</i>, but luckily went no
further with it, for the receipts from an organ of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
opinion which professed republicanism, and at the
same time discountenanced the plans of all existing
or defunct republicans, would have been necessarily
scanty. There being no appearance of any
demand, present or prospective, for philanthropists,
he tried to get employment as correspondent of
a newspaper. Here also it was impossible that he
should succeed; he was too great to be merged in
the editorial We, and had too well defined a private
opinion on all subjects to be able to express that
average of public opinion which constitutes able
editorials. But so it is that to the prophet in the
wilderness the birds of ill omen are already on the
wing with food from heaven; and while Wordsworth&#8217;s
relatives were getting impatient at what
they considered his waste of time, while one thought
he had gifts enough to make a good parson, and
another lamented the rare attorney that was lost
in him, the prescient muse guided the hand of
Raisley Calvert while he wrote the poet&#8217;s name in
his will for a legacy of &pound;900. By the death of
Calvert, in 1795, this timely help came to Wordsworth
at the turning-point of his life, and made it
honest for him to write poems that will never die,
instead of theatrical critiques as ephemeral as
play-bills, or leaders that led only to oblivion.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1795 Wordsworth and his
sister took up their abode at Racedown Lodge, near
Crewkerne, in Dorsetshire. Here nearly two years
were passed, chiefly in the study of poetry, and
Wordsworth to some extent recovered from the
fierce disappointment of his political dreams, and
regained that equable tenor of mind which alone
is consistent with a healthy productiveness. Here
Coleridge, who had contrived to see something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
more in the <i>Descriptive Sketches</i> than the public
had discovered there, first made his acquaintance.
The sympathy and appreciation of an intellect
like Coleridge&#8217;s supplied him with that external
motive to activity which is the chief use of popularity,
and justified to him his opinion of his own
powers. It was now that the tragedy of <i>The
Borderers</i> was for the most part written, and that
plan of the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> suggested which gave
Wordsworth a clue to lead him out of the metaphysical
labyrinth in which he was entangled. It
was agreed between the two young friends, that
Wordsworth was to be a philosophic poet, and, by
a good fortune uncommon to such conspiracies,
Nature had already consented to the arrangement.
In July 1797, the two Wordsworths removed to
Allfoxden in Somersetshire, that they might be
near Coleridge, who in the meanwhile had married
and settled himself at Nether Stowey. In November
<i>The Borderers</i> was finished, and Wordsworth went
up to London with his sister to offer it for the stage.
The good Genius of the poet again interposing, the
play was decisively rejected, and Wordsworth went
back to Allfoxden, himself the hero of that first
tragi-comedy so common to young authors.</p>

<p>The play has fine passages, but is as unreal as
<i>Jane Eyre</i>. It shares with many of Wordsworth&#8217;s
narrative poems the defect of being written to
illustrate an abstract moral theory, so that the
overbearing thesis is continually thrusting the
poetry to the wall. Applied to the drama, such
predestination makes all the personages puppets
and disenables them for being characters. Wordsworth
seems to have felt this when he published
<i>The Borderers</i> in 1842, and says in a note that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
was &#8216;at first written ... without any view to its
exhibition upon the stage&#8217;. But he was mistaken.
The contemporaneous letters of Coleridge to Cottle
show that he was long in giving up the hope of
getting it accepted by some theatrical manager.</p>

<p>He now applied himself to the preparation of the
first volume of the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> for the press, and
it was published toward the close of 1798. The
book, which contained also <i>The Ancient Mariner</i>
of Coleridge, attracted little notice, and that in
great part contemptuous. When Mr. Cottle, the
publisher, shortly after sold his copyrights to
Mr. Longman, that of the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> was
reckoned at <i>zero</i>, and it was at last given up to the
authors. A few persons were not wanting, however,
who discovered the dawn-streaks of a new
day in that light which the critical fire-brigade
thought to extinguish with a few contemptuous
spurts of cold water.</p>

<p>Lord Byron describes himself as waking one
morning and finding himself famous, and it is quite
an ordinary fact, that a blaze may be made with
a little saltpetre that will be stared at by thousands
who would have thought the sunrise tedious. If
we may believe his biographer, Wordsworth might
have said that he awoke and found himself infamous,
for the publication of the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>
undoubtedly raised him to the distinction of being
the least popular poet in England. Parnassus has
two peaks; the one where improvising poets cluster;
the other where the singer of deep secrets sits alone,&mdash;a
peak veiled sometimes from the whole morning
of a generation by earth-born mists and smoke of
kitchen fires, only to glow the more consciously at
sunset, and after nightfall to crown itself with imperishable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
stars. Wordsworth had that self-trust
which in the man of genius is sublime, and in the
man of talent insufferable. It mattered not to
him though all the reviewers had been in a chorus
of laughter or conspiracy of silence behind him.
He went quietly over to Germany to write more
Lyrical Ballads, and to begin a poem on the growth
of his own mind, at a time when there were only two
men in the world (himself and Coleridge) who were
aware that he had one, or at least one anywise
differing from those mechanically uniform ones
which are stuck drearily, side by side, in the great
pin-paper of society.</p>

<p>In Germany Wordsworth dined in company
with Klopstock, and after dinner they had
a conversation, of which Wordsworth took notes.
The respectable old poet, who was passing the
evening of his days by the chimney-corner, Darby
and Joan like, with his respectable Muse, seems
to have been rather bewildered by the apparition
of a living genius. The record is of value now
chiefly for the insight it gives us into Wordsworth&#8217;s
mind. Among other things he said, &#8216;that it was
the province of a great poet to raise people up to
his own level, not to descend to theirs&#8217;,&mdash;memorable
words, the more memorable that a literary
life of sixty years was in keeping with them.</p>

<p>It would be instructive to know what were
Wordsworth&#8217;s studies during his winter in Goslar.
De Quincey&#8217;s statement is mere conjecture. It
may be guessed fairly enough that he would seek
an entrance to the German language by the easy
path of the ballad, a course likely to confirm him
in his theories as to the language of poetry. The
Spinozism with which he has been not unjustly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
charged was certainly not due to any German
influence, for it appears unmistakably in the
<i>Lines composed at Tintern Abbey</i> in July 1798.
It is more likely to have been derived from his
talks with Coleridge in 1797. When Emerson
visited him in 1833, he spoke with loathing of
<i>Wilhelm Meister</i>, a part of which he had read
in Carlyle&#8217;s translation apparently. There was
some affectation in this, it should seem, for he had
read Smollett. On the whole, it may be fairly
concluded that the help of Germany in the
development of his genius may be reckoned as
very small, though there is certainly a marked
resemblance both in form and sentiment between
some of his earlier lyrics and those of Goethe.
His poem of the <i>Thorn</i>, though vastly more imaginative,
may have been suggested by B&uuml;rger&#8217;s
<i>Pfarrer&#8217;s Tochter von Taubenhain</i>. The little grave
<i>drei Spannen lang</i>, in its conscientious measurement,
certainly recalls a famous couplet in the English
poem.</p>

<p>After spending the winter at Goslar, Wordsworth
and his sister returned to England in the spring
of 1799, and settled at Grasmere in Westmorland.
In 1800, the first edition of the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>
being exhausted, it was republished with the
addition of another volume, Mr. Longman paying
&pound;100 for the copyright of two editions. The book
passed to a second edition in 1802, and to a third
in 1805. Wordsworth sent a copy of it, with a
manly letter, to Mr. Fox, particularly recommending
to his attention the poems <i>Michael</i> and
<i>The Brothers</i>, as displaying the strength and
permanence among a simple and rural population
of those domestic affections which were certain to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
decay gradually under the influence of manufactories
and poor-houses. Mr. Fox wrote a civil acknowledgement,
saying that his favourites among the
poems were <i>Harry Gill</i>, <i>We are Seven</i>, <i>The Mad
Mother</i>, and <i>The Idiot</i>, but that he was prepossessed
against the use of blank verse for simple
subjects. Any political significance in the poems
he was apparently unable to see. To this second
edition Wordsworth prefixed an argumentative
Preface, in which he nailed to the door of the
cathedral of English song the critical theses which
he was to maintain against all comers in his poetry
and his life. It was a new thing for an author to
undertake to show the goodness of his verses by
the logic and learning of his prose; but Wordsworth
carried to the reform of poetry all that fervour and
faith which had lost their political object, and it
is another proof of the sincerity and greatness of
his mind, and of that heroic simplicity which is
their concomitant, that he could do so calmly
what was sure to seem ludicrous to the greater
number of his readers. Fifty years have since
demonstrated that the true judgement of one man
outweighs any counterpoise of false judgement,
and that the faith of mankind is guided to a man
only by a well-founded faith in himself. To this
<i>Defensio</i> Wordsworth afterward added a supplement,
and the two form a treatise of permanent
value for philosophic statement and decorous
English. Their only ill effect has been, that they
have encouraged many otherwise deserving young
men to set a Sibylline value on their verses in
proportion as they were unsaleable. The strength
of an argument for self-reliance drawn from the
example of a great man depends wholly on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
greatness of him who uses it; such arguments
being like coats of mail, which, though they serve
the strong against arrow-flights and lance-thrusts,
may only suffocate the weak or sink him the sooner
in the waters of oblivion.</p>

<p>An advertisement prefixed to the <i>Lyrical
Ballads</i>, as originally published in one volume,
warned the reader that &#8216;they were written chiefly
with a view to ascertain how far <i>the language of
conversation in the middle and lower classes</i> of
society is adapted to the purposes of poetic
pleasure&#8217;. In his preface to the second edition, in
two volumes, Wordsworth already found himself
forced to shift his ground a little (perhaps in
deference to the wider view and finer sense of
Coleridge), and now says of the former volume
that &#8216;it was published as an experiment which,
I hoped, might be of some use to ascertain how
far, by fitting to metrical arrangement, <i>a selection
of the real language of men in a state of vivid sensation</i>,
that sort of pleasure and that quantity of
pleasure may be imparted which a poet may
<i>rationally endeavour</i> to impart&#8217;. Here is evidence
of a retreat towards a safer position, though
Wordsworth seems to have remained unconvinced
at heart, and for many years longer clung obstinately
to the passages of bald prose into which
his original theory had betrayed him. In 1815
his opinions had undergone a still further change,
and an assiduous study of the qualities of his own
mind and of his own poetic method (the two subjects
in which alone he was ever a thorough
scholar) had convinced him that poetry was in no
sense that appeal to the understanding which is
implied by the words &#8216;rationally endeavour to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
impart&#8217;. In the preface of that year he says,
&#8216;The observations prefixed to that portion of these
volumes which was published many years ago
under the title of <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> have so little of
special application to the greater part of the present
enlarged and diversified collection, that they could
not with propriety stand as an introduction to it.&#8217;
It is a pity that he could not have become an
earlier convert to Coleridge&#8217;s pithy definition,
that &#8216;prose was words in their best order, and
poetry the <i>best</i> words in the best order&#8217;. But
idealization was something that Wordsworth was
obliged to learn painfully. It did not come to him
naturally as to Spenser and Shelley and to Coleridge
in his higher moods. Moreover, it was in the
too frequent choice of subjects incapable of being
idealized without a manifest jar between theme
and treatment that Wordsworth&#8217;s great mistake
lay. For example, in <i>The Blind Highland Boy</i> he
had originally the following stanzas:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Strong is the current, but be mild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye waves, and spare the helpless child!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ye in anger fret or chafe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bee-hive would be ship as safe<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As that in which he sails.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But say, what was it? Thought of fear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well may ye tremble when ye hear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;A household tub like one of those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which women use to wash their clothes,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">This carried the blind boy.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In endeavouring to get rid of the downright
vulgarity of phrase in the last stanza, Wordsworth
invents an impossible tortoise-shell, and thus robs
his story of the reality which alone gave it a living
interest. Any extemporized raft would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
floated the boy down to immortality. But Wordsworth
never quite learned the distinction between
Fact, which suffocates the Muse, and Truth, which
is the very breath of her nostrils. Study and self-culture
did much for him, but they never quite
satisfied him that he was capable of making a
mistake. He yielded silently to friendly remonstrance
on certain points, and gave up, for example,
the ludicrous exactness of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I&#8217;ve measured it from side to side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Tis three feet long and two feet wide.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">But I doubt if he was ever really convinced, and
to his dying day he could never quite shake off
that habit of over-minute detail which renders
the narratives of uncultivated people so tedious,
and sometimes so distasteful. <i>Simon Lee</i>, after
his latest revision, still contains verses like these:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And he is lean and he is sick;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His body, dwindled and awry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rests upon ankles swollen and thick;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His legs are thin and dry;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="dotted2" style="margin-left: 5%">&nbsp;</p>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Few months of life he has in store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he to you will tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For still, the more he works, the more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do his weak ankles swell,&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">which are not only prose, but <i>bad</i> prose, and moreover
guilty of the same fault for which Wordsworth
condemned Dr. Johnson&#8217;s famous parody on the
ballad-style,&mdash;that their &#8216;<i>matter</i> is contemptible&#8217;.
The sonorousness of conviction with which Wordsworth
sometimes gives utterance to commonplaces
of thought and trivialities of sentiment has a ludicrous
effect on the profane and even on the faithful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
in unguarded moments. We are reminded of a
passage in <i>The Excursion</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">List! I heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From yon huge breast of rock <i>a solemn bleat</i>,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>In 1800 the friendship of Wordsworth with
Lamb began, and was thenceforward never interrupted.
He continued to live at Grasmere, conscientiously
diligent in the composition of poems,
secure of finding the materials of glory within and
around him; for his genius taught him that
inspiration is no product of a foreign shore, and
that no adventurer ever found it, though he
wandered as long as Ulysses. Meanwhile the
appreciation of the best minds and the gratitude
of the purest hearts gradually centred more and
more towards him. In 1802 he made a short visit
to France, in company with Miss Wordsworth, and
soon after his return to England was married to
Mary Hutchinson, on the 4th of October of the
same year. Of the good fortune of this marriage
no other proof is needed than the purity and
serenity of his poems, and its record is to be sought
nowhere else.</p>

<p>On the 18th of June, 1803, his first child, John,
was born, and on the 14th of August of the same
year he set out with his sister on a foot journey
into Scotland. Coleridge was their companion
during a part of this excursion, of which Miss
Wordsworth kept a full diary. In Scotland he
made the acquaintance of Scott, who recited to
him a part of the <i>Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>, then in
manuscript. The travellers returned to Grasmere
on the 25th of September. It was during this year<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
that Wordsworth&#8217;s intimacy with the excellent
Sir George Beaumont began. Sir George was an
amateur painter of considerable merit, and his
friendship was undoubtedly of service to Wordsworth
in making him familiar with the laws of a
sister art and thus contributing to enlarge the
sympathies of his criticism, the tendency of which
was toward too great exclusiveness. Sir George
Beaumont, dying in 1827, did not forgo his regard
for the poet, but contrived to hold his affection in
mortmain by the legacy of an annuity of &pound;100, to
defray the charges of a yearly journey.</p>

<p>In March 1805, the poet&#8217;s brother, John, lost his
life by the shipwreck of the <i>Abergavenny</i> East-Indiaman,
of which he was captain. He was a man
of great purity and integrity, and sacrificed himself
to his sense of duty by refusing to leave the
ship till it was impossible to save him. Wordsworth
was deeply attached to him, and felt such
grief at his death as only solitary natures like his
are capable of, though mitigated by a sense of the
heroism which was the cause of it. The need of
mental activity as affording an outlet to intense
emotion may account for the great productiveness
of this and the following year. He now completed
<i>The Prelude</i>, wrote <i>The Waggoner</i>, and increased
the number of his smaller poems enough to fill
two volumes, which were published in 1807.</p>

<p>This collection, which contained some of the
most beautiful of his shorter pieces, and among
others the incomparable <i>Odes</i> to Duty and on
Immortality, did not reach a second edition till
1815. The reviewers had another laugh, and rival
poets pillaged while they scoffed, particularly
Byron, among whose verses a bit of Wordsworth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
showed as incongruously as a sacred vestment on
the back of some buccaneering plunderer of an
abbey. There was a general combination to put
him down, but on the other hand there was a
powerful party in his favour, consisting of William
Wordsworth. He not only continued in good
heart himself, but, reversing the order usual on
such occasions, kept up the spirits of his friends.</p>

<p>Wordsworth passed the winter of 1806-7 in a
house of Sir George Beaumont&#8217;s, at Coleorton in
Leicestershire, the cottage at Grasmere having
become too small for his increased family. On
his return to the Vale of Grasmere he rented the
house at Allan Bank, where he lived three years.
During this period he appears to have written very
little poetry, for which his biographer assigns as
a primary reason the smokiness of the Allan Bank
chimneys. This will hardly account for the failure
of the summer crop, especially as Wordsworth
composed chiefly in the open air. It did not
prevent him from writing a pamphlet upon the
Convention of Cintra, which was published too
late to attract much attention, though Lamb says
that its effect upon him was like that which one of
Milton&#8217;s tracts might have had upon a contemporary.
It was at Allan Bank that Coleridge
dictated <i>The Friend</i>, and Wordsworth contributed
to it two essays, one in answer to a letter of
Mathetes (Professor Wilson), and the other on
Epitaphs, republished in the Notes to <i>The
Excursion</i>. Here also he wrote his <i>Description
of the Scenery of the Lakes</i>. Perhaps a truer
explanation of the comparative silence of Wordsworth&#8217;s
Muse during these years is to be found in
the intense interest which he took in current events,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>
whose variety, picturesqueness, and historical
significance were enough to absorb all the energies
of his imagination.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1811 Wordsworth removed to
the Parsonage at Grasmere. Here he remained
two years, and here he had his second intimate
experience of sorrow in the loss of two of his
children, Catharine and Thomas, one of whom
died 4th June, and the other 1st December, 1812.
Early in 1813 he bought Rydal Mount, and, having
removed thither, changed his abode no more during
the rest of his life. In March of this year he was
appointed Distributor of Stamps for the county of
Westmorland, an office whose receipts rendered
him independent, and whose business he was able
to do by deputy, thus leaving him ample leisure
for nobler duties. De Quincey speaks of this
appointment as an instance of the remarkable
good luck which waited upon Wordsworth through
his whole life. In our view it is only another
illustration of that scripture which describes the
righteous as never forsaken. Good luck is the
willing handmaid of upright, energetic character,
and conscientious observance of duty. Wordsworth
owed his nomination to the friendly exertions of
the Earl of Lonsdale, who desired to atone as far
as might be for the injustice of the first Earl, and
who respected the honesty of the man more than
he appreciated the originality of the poet. The
Collectorship at Whitehaven (a more lucrative
office) was afterwards offered to Wordsworth, and
declined. He had enough for independence, and
wished nothing more. Still later, on the death of
the Stamp-Distributor for Cumberland, a part of
that district was annexed to Westmorland, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
Wordsworth&#8217;s income was raised to something
more than &pound;1,000 a year.</p>

<p>In 1814 he made his second tour in Scotland,
visiting Yarrow in company with the Ettrick
Shepherd. During this year <i>The Excursion</i> was
published, in an edition of five hundred copies,
which supplied the demand for six years. Another
edition of the same number of copies was published
in 1827, and not exhausted till 1834. In 1815
<i>The White Doe of Rylstone</i> appeared, and in
1816 <i>A Letter to a Friend of Burns</i>, in which
Wordsworth gives his opinion upon the limits to
be observed by the biographers of literary men.
It contains many valuable suggestions, but allows
hardly scope enough for personal details, to which
he was constitutionally indifferent. Nearly the
same date may be ascribed to a rhymed translation
of the first three books of the <i>Aeneid</i>, a specimen of
which was printed in the Cambridge <i>Philological
Museum</i> (1832). In 1819 <i>Peter Bell</i>, written twenty
years before, was published, and, perhaps in
consequence of the ridicule of the reviewers, found
a more rapid sale than any of his previous volumes.
<i>The Waggoner</i>, printed in the same year, was less
successful. His next publication was the volume
of <i>Sonnets on the river Duddon</i>, with some
miscellaneous poems, 1820. A tour on the
Continent in 1820 furnished the subjects for
another collection, published in 1822. This was
followed in the same year by the volume of
<i>Ecclesiastical Sketches</i>. His subsequent publications
were <i>Yarrow Revisited</i>, 1835, and the tragedy of
<i>The Borderers</i>, 1842.</p>

<p>During all these years his fame was increasing
slowly but steadily, and his age gathered to itself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span>
the reverence and the troops of friends which his
poems and the nobly simple life reflected in them
deserved. Public honours followed private appreciation.
In 1838 the University of Dublin conferred
upon him the degree of D.C.L. In 1839 Oxford
did the same, and the reception of the poet (now
in his seventieth year) at the University was
enthusiastic. In 1842 he resigned his office of
Stamp-Distributor, and Sir Robert Peel had the
honour of putting him upon the civil list for a pension
of &pound;300. In 1843 he was appointed Laureate, with
the express understanding that it was a tribute of
respect, involving no duties except such as might
be self-imposed. His only official production was
an Ode for the installation of Prince Albert as
Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. His
life was prolonged yet seven years, almost, it should
seem, that he might receive that honour which he
had truly conquered for himself by the unflinching
bravery of a literary life of half a century,
unparalleled for the scorn with which its labours
were received, and the victorious acknowledgement
which at last crowned them. Surviving nearly
all his contemporaries, he had, if ever any man had,
a foretaste of immortality, enjoying in a sort his
own posthumous renown, for the hardy slowness
of its growth gave a safe pledge of its durability.
He died on the 23rd of April, 1850, the anniversary
of the death of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>We have thus briefly sketched the life of
Wordsworth,&mdash;a life uneventful even for a man of
letters; a life like that of an oak, of quiet self-development,
throwing out stronger roots toward
the side whence the prevailing storm-blasts blow,
and of tougher fibre in proportion to the rocky<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span>
nature of the soil in which it grows. The life and
growth of his mind, and the influences which shaped
it, are to be looked for, even more than is the case
with most poets, in his works, for he deliberately
recorded them there.</p>

<p>Of his personal characteristics little is related.
He was somewhat above the middle height, but,
according to De Quincey, of indifferent figure, the
shoulders being narrow and drooping. His finest
feature was the eye, which was grey and full of
spiritual light. Leigh Hunt says: &#8216;I never beheld
eyes that looked so inspired, so supernatural.
They were like fires, half burning, half smouldering,
with a sort of acrid fixture of regard. One might
imagine Ezekiel or Isaiah to have had such eyes.&#8217;
Southey tells us that he had no sense of smell, and
Haydon that he had none of form. The best
likeness of him, in De Quincey&#8217;s judgement, is
the portrait of Milton prefixed to Richardson&#8217;s
notes on <i>Paradise Lost</i>. He was active in his
habits, composing in the open air, and generally
dictating his poems. His daily life was regular,
simple, and frugal; his manners were dignified and
kindly; and in his letters and recorded conversations
it is remarkable how little that was personal
entered into his judgement of contemporaries.</p>

<p>The true rank of Wordsworth among poets is,
perhaps, not even yet to be fairly estimated, so
hard is it to escape into the quiet hall of judgement
uninflamed by the tumult of partisanship which
besets the doors.</p>

<p>Coming to manhood, predetermined to be a great
poet, at a time when the artificial school of poetry
was enthroned with all the authority of long
succession and undisputed legitimacy, it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
almost inevitable that Wordsworth, who, both by
nature and judgement was a rebel against the
existing order, should become a partisan. Unfortunately,
he became not only the partisan of
a system, but of William Wordsworth as its
representative. Right in general principle, he
thus necessarily became wrong in particulars.
Justly convinced that greatness only achieves its
ends by implicitly obeying its own instincts, he
perhaps reduced the following his instincts too
much to a system, mistook his own resentments
for the promptings of his natural genius, and,
compelling principle to the measure of his own
temperament or even of the controversial exigency
of the moment, fell sometimes into the error of
making naturalness itself artificial. If a poet
resolve to be original, it will end commonly in his
being merely peculiar.</p>

<p>Wordsworth himself departed more and more in
practice, as he grew older, from the theories which
he had laid down in his prefaces;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> but those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>theories undoubtedly had a great effect in retarding
the growth of his fame. He had carefully constructed
a pair of spectacles through which his earlier poems
were to be studied, and the public insisted on
looking through them at his mature works, and were
consequently unable to see fairly what required
a different focus. He forced his readers to come to
his poetry with a certain amount of conscious
preparation, and thus gave them beforehand the
impression of something like mechanical artifice,
and deprived them of the contented repose of
implicit faith. To the child a watch seems to be
a living creature; but Wordsworth would not
let his readers be children, and did injustice to
himself by giving them an uneasy doubt whether
creations which really throbbed with the very
heart&#8217;s-blood of genius, and were alive with nature&#8217;s
life of life, were not contrivances of wheels and
springs. A naturalness which we are told to expect
has lost the crowning grace of nature. The men
who walked in Cornelius Agrippa&#8217;s visionary
gardens had probably no more pleasurable
emotion than that of a shallow wonder, or an
equally shallow self-satisfaction in thinking they
had hit upon the secret of the thaumaturgy; but
to a tree that has grown as God willed we come
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>without a theory and with no botanical predilections,
enjoying it simply and thankfully; or the Imagination
recreates for us its past summers and winters,
the birds that have nested and sung in it, the sheep
that have clustered in its shade, the winds that have
visited it, the cloud-bergs that have drifted over it,
and the snows that have ermined it in winter.
The Imagination is a faculty that flouts at
foreordination, and Wordsworth seemed to do all
he could to cheat his readers of her company by
laying out paths with a peremptory <i>Do not step off
the gravel!</i> at the opening of each, and preparing
pitfalls for every conceivable emotion, with guide-boards
to tell each when and where it must be
caught.</p>

<p>But if these things stood in the way of immediate
appreciation, he had another theory which interferes
more seriously with the total and permanent
effect of his poems. He was theoretically determined
not only to be a philosophic poet, but to be a <i>great</i>
philosophic poet, and to this end he must produce
an epic. Leaving aside the question whether the
epic be obsolete or not, it may be doubted whether
the history of a single man&#8217;s mind is universal
enough in its interest to furnish all the requirements
of the epic machinery, and it may be more than
doubted whether a poet&#8217;s philosophy be ordinary
metaphysics, divisible into chapter and section.
It is rather something which is more energetic in
a word than in a whole treatise, and our hearts
unclose themselves instinctively at its simple <i>Open
sesame!</i> while they would stand firm against the
reading of the whole body of philosophy. In point
of fact, the one element of greatness which <i>The
Excursion</i> possesses indisputably is heaviness. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span>
is only the episodes that are universally read, and
the effect of these is diluted by the connecting
and accompanying lectures on metaphysics.
Wordsworth had his epic mould to fill, and, like
Benvenuto Cellini in casting his Perseus, was
forced to throw in everything, debasing the metal,
lest it should run short. Separated from the rest,
the episodes are perfect poems in their kind, and
without example in the language.</p>

<p>Wordsworth, like most solitary men of strong
minds, was a good critic of the substance of poetry,
but somewhat niggardly in the allowance he made
for those subsidiary qualities which make it the
charmer of leisure and the employment of minds
without definite object. It may be doubted,
indeed, whether he set much store by any contemporary
writing but his own, and whether he did
not look upon poetry too exclusively as an exercise
rather of the intellect than as a nepenthe of the
imagination. He says of himself, speaking of his
youth:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i13">In fine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was a better judge of thoughts than words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Misled in estimating words, not only<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By common inexperience of youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But by the trade in classic niceties,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dangerous craft of culling term and phrase<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From languages that want the living voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To carry meaning to the natural heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tell us what is passion, what is truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What reason, what simplicity and sense.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Though he here speaks in the preterite tense,
this was always true of him, and his thought seems
often to lean upon a word too weak to bear its
weight. No reader of adequate insight can help
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span>regretting that he did not earlier give himself to
&#8216;the trade of classic niceties&#8217;. It was precisely
this which gives to the blank-verse of Landor the
severe dignity and reserved force which alone
among later poets recall the tune of Milton, and
to which Wordsworth never attained. Indeed,
Wordsworth&#8217;s blank-verse (though the passion be
profounder) is always essentially that of Cowper.
They were alike also in their love of outward
nature and of simple things. The main difference
between them is one of scenery rather than of
sentiment, between the lifelong familiar of the
mountains and the dweller on the plain.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that in Wordsworth the
very highest powers of the poetic mind were
associated with a certain tendency to the diffuse
and commonplace. It is in the understanding
(always prosaic) that the great golden veins of his
imagination are imbedded. He wrote too much
to write always well; for it is not a great Xerxes-army
of words, but a compact Greek ten thousand,
that march safely down to posterity. He set
tasks to his divine faculty, which is much the same
as trying to make Jove&#8217;s eagle do the service of
a clucking hen. Throughout <i>The Prelude</i> and <i>The
Excursion</i> he seems striving to bind the wizard
Imagination with the sand-ropes of dry disquisition,
and to have forgotten the potent spell-word which
would make the particles cohere. There is an
arenaceous quality in the style which makes
progress wearisome. Yet with what splendours
as of mountain-sunsets are we rewarded! what
golden rounds of verse do we not see stretching
heavenward with angels ascending and descending!
what haunting harmonies hover around us deep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span>
and eternal like the undying baritone of the sea!
and if we are compelled to fare through sands and
desert wildernesses, how often do we not hear airy
shapes that syllable our names with a startling
personal appeal to our highest consciousness and
our noblest aspiration, such as we wait for in vain
in any other poet!</p>

<p>Take from Wordsworth all which an honest
criticism cannot but allow, and what is left will
show how truly great he was. He had no humour,
no dramatic power, and his temperament was
of that dry and juiceless quality, that in all his
published correspondence you shall not find
a letter, but only essays. If we consider carefully
where he was most successful, we shall find that
it was not so much in description of natural scenery,
or delineation of character, as in vivid expression
of the effect produced by external objects and
events upon his own mind, and of the shape and
hue (perhaps momentary) which they in turn took
from his mood or temperament. His finest
passages are always monologues. He had a fondness
for particulars, and there are parts of his
poems which remind us of local histories in the
undue relative importance given to trivial matters.
He was the historian of Wordsworthshire. This
power of particularization (for it is as truly
a power as generalization) is what gives such vigour
and greatness to single lines and sentiments of
Wordsworth, and to poems developing a single
thought or sentiment. It was this that made him
so fond of the sonnet. That sequestered nook
forced upon him the limits which his fecundity
(if I may not say his garrulity) was never self-denying
enough to impose on itself. It suits his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
solitary and meditative temper, and it was there
that Lamb (an admirable judge of what was
permanent in literature) liked him best. Its
narrow bounds, but fourteen paces from end to
end, turn into a virtue his too common fault of
giving undue prominence to every passing emotion.
He excels in monologue, and the law of the sonnet
tempers monologue with mercy. In <i>The Excursion</i>
we are driven to the subterfuge of a French
verdict of extenuating circumstances. His mind
had not that reach and elemental movement of
Milton&#8217;s, which, like the trade-wind, gathered to
itself thoughts and images like stately fleets from
every quarter; some deep with silks and spicery,
some brooding over the silent thunders of their
battailous armaments, but all swept forward in
their destined track, over the long billows of his
verse, every inch of canvas strained by the unifying
breath of their common epic impulse. It was an
organ that Milton mastered, mighty in compass,
capable equally of the trumpet&#8217;s ardours or the slim
delicacy of the flute, and sometimes it bursts
forth in great crashes through his prose, as if he
touched it for solace in the intervals of his toil.
If Wordsworth sometimes puts the trumpet to
his lips, yet he lays it aside soon and willingly for
his appropriate instrument, the pastoral reed.
And it is not one that grew by any vulgar stream,
but that which Apollo breathed through, tending
the flocks of Admetus,&mdash;that which Pan endowed
with every melody of the visible universe,&mdash;the
same in which the soul of the despairing nymph
took refuge and gifted with her dual nature,&mdash;so
that ever and anon, amid the notes of human joy
or sorrow, there comes suddenly a deeper and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span>
almost awful tone, thrilling us into dim consciousness
of a forgotten divinity.</p>

<p>Wordsworth&#8217;s absolute want of humour, while it
no doubt confirmed his self-confidence by making
him insensible both to the comical incongruity
into which he was often led by his earlier theory
concerning the language of poetry and to the not
unnatural ridicule called forth by it, seems to
have been indicative of a certain dullness of
perception in other directions.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> We cannot help
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>feeling that the material of his nature was essentially
prose, which, in his inspired moments, he had the
power of transmuting, but which, whenever the
inspiration failed or was factitious, remained
obstinately leaden. The normal condition of
many poets would seem to approach that temperature
to which Wordsworth&#8217;s mind could be raised
only by the white heat of profoundly inward
passion. And in proportion to the intensity
needful to make his nature thoroughly aglow is
the very high quality of his best verses. They
seem rather the productions of nature than of man,
and have the lastingness of such, delighting our
age with the same startle of newness and beauty
that pleased our youth. Is it his thought?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>It has the shifting inward lustre of diamond.
Is it his feeling? It is as delicate as the impressions
of fossil ferns. He seems to have caught and fixed
for ever in immutable grace the most evanescent
and intangible of our intuitions, the very ripple-marks
on the remotest shores of being. But this
intensity of mood which insures high quality is by
its very nature incapable of prolongation, and
Wordsworth, in endeavouring it, falls more below
himself, and is, more even than many poets his
inferiors in imaginative quality, a poet of passages.
Indeed, one cannot help having the feeling sometimes
that the poem is there for the sake of these
passages, rather than that these are the natural
jets and elations of a mind energized by the
rapidity of its own motion. In other words, the
happy couplet or gracious image seems not to
spring from the inspiration of the poem conceived
as a whole, but rather to have dropped of itself
into the mind of the poet in one of his rambles, who
then, in a less rapt mood, has patiently built up
around it a setting of verse too often ungraceful
in form and of a material whose cheapness may
cast a doubt on the priceless quality of the gem it
encumbers.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> During the most happily productive
period of his life, Wordsworth was impatient of
what may be called the mechanical portion of his
art. His wife and sister seem from the first to
have been his scribes. In later years, he had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span>learned and often insisted on the truth that poetry
was an art no less than a gift, and corrected his
poems in cold blood, sometimes to their detriment.
But he certainly had more of the vision than of the
faculty divine, and was always a little numb on
the side of form and proportion. Perhaps his best
poem in these respects is the <i>Laodamia</i>, and it is
not uninstructive to learn from his own lips that
&#8216;it cost him more trouble than almost anything of
equal length he had ever written&#8217;. His longer
poems (miscalled epical) have no more intimate
bond of union than their more or less immediate
relation to his own personality. Of character
other than his own he had but a faint conception,
and all the personages of <i>The Excursion</i> that
are not Wordsworth are the merest shadows of
himself upon mist, for his self-concentrated nature
was incapable of projecting itself into the consciousness
of other men and seeing the springs of action
at their source in the recesses of individual
character. The best parts of these longer poems
are bursts of impassioned soliloquy, and his fingers
were always clumsy at the <i>callida junctura</i>. The
stream of narration is sluggish, if varied by times
with pleasing reflections (<i>viridesque placido aequore
sylvas</i>); we are forced to do our own rowing, and
only when the current is hemmed in by some
narrow gorge of the poet&#8217;s personal consciousness
do we feel ourselves snatched along on the smooth
but impetuous rush of unmistakable inspiration.
The fact that what is precious in Wordsworth&#8217;s
poetry was (more truly even than with some
greater poets than he) a gift rather than an
achievement should always be borne in mind in
taking the measure of his power. I know not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span>
whether to call it height or depth, this peculiarity
of his, but it certainly endows those parts of his
work which we should distinguish as Wordsworthian
with an unexpectedness and impressiveness of
originality such as we feel in the presence of Nature
herself. He seems to have been half conscious of
this, and recited his own poems to all comers with
an enthusiasm of wondering admiration that
would have been profoundly comic but for its
simple sincerity and for the fact that William
Wordsworth, Esquire, of Rydal Mount, was one
person, and the William Wordsworth whom he so
heartily reverenced quite another. We recognize
two voices in him, as Stephano did in Caliban.
There are Jeremiah and his scribe Baruch. If the
prophet cease from dictating, the amanuensis,
rather than be idle, employs his pen in jotting
down some anecdotes of his master, how he one
day went out and saw an old woman, and the
next day did <i>not</i>, and so came home and dictated
some verses on this ominous phenomenon, and
how another day he saw a cow. These marginal
annotations have been carelessly taken up into the
text, have been religiously held by the pious to be
orthodox scripture, and by dexterous exegesis have
been made to yield deeply oracular meanings.
Presently the real prophet takes up the word
again and speaks as one divinely inspired, the
Voice of a higher and invisible power. Wordsworth&#8217;s
better utterances have the bare sincerity, the
absolute abstraction from time and place, the
immunity from decay, that belong to the grand
simplicities of the Bible. They seem not more his
own than ours and every man&#8217;s, the word of the
inalterable Mind. This gift of his was naturally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[604]</a></span>
very much a matter of temperament, and accordingly
by far the greater part of his finer product
belongs to the period of his prime, ere Time had
set his lumpish foot on the pedal that deadens the
nerves of animal sensibility.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> He did not grow as
those poets do in whom the artistic sense is predominant.
One of the most delightful fancies of
the Genevese humorist, Toepffer, is the poet Albert,
who, having had his portrait drawn by a highly
idealizing hand, does his best afterwards to look
like it. Many of Wordsworth&#8217;s later poems seem
like rather unsuccessful efforts to resemble his
former self. They would never, as Sir John
Harington says of poetry, &#8216;keep a child from play
and an old man from the chimney-corner&#8217;.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Chief Justice Marshall once blandly interrupted
a junior counsel who was arguing certain obvious
points of law at needless length, by saying, &#8216;Brother
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span>Jones, there are <i>some</i> things which a Supreme Court
of the United States sitting in equity may be
presumed to know.&#8217; Wordsworth has this fault
of enforcing and restating obvious points till the
reader feels as if his own intelligence were somewhat
underrated. He is over-conscientious in giving us
full measure, and once profoundly absorbed in the
sound of his own voice, he knows not when to stop.
If he feel himself flagging, he has a droll way of
keeping the floor, as it were, by asking himself
a series of questions sometimes not needing, and
often incapable of answer. There are three stanzas
of such near the close of the First Part of <i>Peter
Bell</i>, where Peter first catches a glimpse of the
dead body in the water, all happily incongruous,
and ending with one which reaches the height of
comicality:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Is it a fiend that to a stake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fire his desperate self is tethering?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or stubborn spirit doomed to yell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In solitary ward or cell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ten thousand miles from all his brethren?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">The same want of humour which made him
insensible to incongruity may perhaps account also
for the singular unconsciousness of disproportion
which so often strikes us in his poetry. For
example, a little farther on in <i>Peter Bell</i> we find:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Now</i>&mdash;like a tempest-shattered bark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That overwhelmed and prostrate lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a moment to the verge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is lifted of a foaming surge&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full suddenly the Ass doth rise!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">And one cannot help thinking that the similes of
the huge stone, the sea-beast, and the cloud, noble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[606]</a></span>
as they are in themselves, are somewhat too lofty
for the service to which they are put.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>The movement of Wordsworth&#8217;s mind was too slow
and his mood too meditative for narrative poetry.
He values his own thoughts and reflections too
much to sacrifice the least of them to the interests
of his story. Moreover, it is never action that
interests him, but the subtle motives that lead
to or hinder it. <i>The Waggoner</i> involuntarily
suggests a comparison with <i>Tam O&#8217;Shanter</i>,
infinitely to its own disadvantage. <i>Peter Bell</i>,
full though it be of profound touches and subtle
analysis, is lumbering and disjointed. Even Lamb
was forced to confess that he did not like it.
<i>The White Doe</i>, the most Wordsworthian of them
all in the best meaning of the epithet, is also only
the more truly so for being diffuse and reluctant.
What charms in Wordsworth and will charm
for ever is the</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i7">Happy tone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of meditation slipping in between<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beauty coming and the beauty gone.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">A few poets, in the exquisite adaptation of their
words to the tune of our own feelings and fancies,
in the charm of their manner, indefinable as the
sympathetic grace of woman, <i>are</i> everything to us
without our being able to say that they are much
in themselves. They rather narcotize than fortify.
Wordsworth must subject our mood to his own
before he admits us to his intimacy; but, once
admitted, it is for life, and we find ourselves in his
debt, not for what he has been to us in our hours
of relaxation, but for what he has done for us as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span>a reinforcement of faltering purpose and personal
independence of character. His system of a Nature-cure,
first professed by Dr. Jean Jacques and
continued by Cowper, certainly breaks down as
a whole. The Solitary of <i>The Excursion</i>, who
has not been cured of his scepticism by living
among the medicinal mountains, is, so far as we
can see, equally proof against the lectures of
Pedlar and Parson. Wordsworth apparently felt
that this would be so, and accordingly never saw
his way clear to finishing the poem. But the
treatment, whether a panacea or not, is certainly
wholesome inasmuch as it inculcates abstinence,
exercise, and uncontaminate air. I am not sure,
indeed, that the Nature-cure theory does not tend
to foster in constitutions less vigorous than
Wordsworth&#8217;s what Milton would call a fugitive
and cloistered virtue at a dear expense of manlier
qualities. The ancients and our own Elizabethans,
ere spiritual megrims had become fashionable,
perhaps made more out of life by taking a frank
delight in its action and passion and by grappling
with the facts of this world, rather than muddling
themselves over the insoluble problems of another.
If they had not discovered the picturesque, as we
understand it, they found surprisingly fine scenery
in man and his destiny, and would have seen
something ludicrous, it may be suspected, in the
spectacle of a grown man running to hide his head
in the apron of the Mighty Mother whenever he
had an ache in his finger or got a bruise in the
tussle for existence.</p>

<p>But when, as I have said, our impartiality has
made all those qualifications and deductions against
which even the greatest poet may not plead his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span>
privilege, what is left to Wordsworth is enough to
justify his fame. Even where his genius is wrapped
in clouds, the unconquerable lightning of imagination
struggles through, flashing out unexpected
vistas, and illuminating the humdrum pathway
of our daily thought with a radiance of momentary
consciousness that seems like a revelation. If it
be the most delightful function of the poet to set
our lives to music, yet perhaps he will be even
more sure of our maturer gratitude if he do his
part also as moralist and philosopher to purify
and enlighten; if he define and encourage our
vacillating perceptions of duty; if he piece
together our fragmentary apprehensions of our
own life and that larger life whose unconscious
instruments we are, making of the jumbled bits
of our dissected map of experience a coherent
chart. In the great poets there is an exquisite
sensibility both of soul and sense that sympathizes
like gossamer sea-moss with every movement of
the element in which it floats, but which is rooted
on the solid rock of our common sympathies.
Wordsworth shows less of this finer feminine fibre
of organization than one or two of his contemporaries,
notably than Coleridge or Shelley; but
he was a masculine thinker, and in his more
characteristic poems there is always a kernel of
firm conclusion from far-reaching principles that
stimulates thought and challenges meditation.
Groping in the dark passages of life, we come upon
some axiom of his, as it were a wall that gives us
our bearings and enables us to find an outlet.
Compared with Goethe we feel that he lacks that
serene impartiality of mind which results from
breadth of culture; nay, he seems narrow, insular,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[609]</a></span>
almost provincial. He reminds us of those saints
of Dante who gather brightness by revolving on
their own axis. But through this very limitation
of range he gains perhaps in intensity and the
impressiveness which results from eagerness of
personal conviction. If we read Wordsworth
through, as I have just done, we find ourselves
changing our mind about him at every other page,
so uneven is he. If we read our favourite poems
or passages only, he will seem uniformly great.
And even as regards <i>The Excursion</i> we should
remember how few long poems will bear consecutive
reading. For my part I know of but one,&mdash;the
<i>Odyssey</i>.</p>

<p>None of our great poets can be called popular in
any exact sense of the word, for the highest poetry
deals with thoughts and emotions which inhabit,
like rarest sea-mosses, the doubtful limits of that
shore between our abiding divine and our fluctuating
human nature, rooted in the one, but living in the
other, seldom laid bare, and otherwise visible only
at exceptional moments of entire calm and
clearness. Of no other poet except Shakespeare
have so many phrases become household words as
of Wordsworth. If Pope has made current more
epigrams of worldly wisdom, to Wordsworth
belongs the nobler praise of having defined for us,
and given us for a daily possession, those faint
and vague suggestions of other-worldliness of whose
gentle ministry with our baser nature the hurry
and bustle of life scarcely ever allowed us to be
conscious. He has won for himself a secure
immortality by a depth of intuition which makes
only the best minds at their best hours worthy, or
indeed capable, of his companionship, and by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[610]</a></span>
a homely sincerity of human sympathy which
reaches the humblest heart. Our language owes
him gratitude for the habitual purity and abstinence
of his style, and we who speak it, for having
emboldened us to take delight in simple things,
and to trust ourselves to our own instincts. And
he hath his reward. It needs not to bid</p>

whose influence he grew up, and toward the style against
which he had protested so vigorously, a few examples will
show. The advocate of the language of common life has

than when he thought it needful to rewrite the

is masterly. Compare:

<p>These are surely the versos of an attorney&#8217;s clerk &#8216;penning
a stanza when he should engross&#8217;. It will be noticed
that Wordsworth here also departs from his earlier theory
of the language of poetry by substituting a javelin for
a bullet as less modern and familiar. Had he written</p>

<p class="noin">it would hardly have seemed more like a parody than the
rest. He shows the same insensibility in a note upon the
<i>Ancient Mariner</i> in the second edition of the <i>Lyrical
Ballads</i>: &#8216;The poem of my friend has indeed great defects;
first, that the principal person has no distinct character,
either in his profession of mariner, or as a human being who,
having been long under the control of supernatural impressions,
might be supposed himself to partake of something
supernatural; secondly, that he does not act, but is
continually acted upon; thirdly, that the events, having
no necessary connexion, do not produce each other; and
lastly, that the imagery is somewhat laboriously accumulated.&#8217;
Here is an indictment, to be sure, and drawn,
plainly enough, by the attorney&#8217;s clerk aforenamed. One
would think that the strange charm of Coleridge&#8217;s most
truly original poems lay in this very emancipation from

rills into <i>their</i> main stream&#8217; (<i>Letters, Conversations, and
